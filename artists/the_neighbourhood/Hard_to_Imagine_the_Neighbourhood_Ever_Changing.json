(Tell me, tell me, tell me)\nOoh, darling, ha\u2014I got nothing to lose (Tell me, tell me, tell me)\nNothing to lose (Nothing to lose)\nI got nothing to prove\nNothing to you (Ooh)\n\n[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]\nMovin' at a mile a minute\nSet the pace, I'm goin' over the limit\nAlways wondered what I've been missin'\nThe checkered flag doesn't mean that you're finished, oh\nI got everything that I wanted\nI built myself a house on the hill\nAll my passion fulfilled, saw it fast like a film\nAll that sadness and guilt, now I just wanna chill\nBut I can't, my suntan's from Thailand\nSwimming on a cloud made of hands\nMoney in my pockets, Louis wallet in my pants\nNo AC in the crib but I got plenty of fans\nSaid \"I love you\" too soon\nReached for the stars and I hit the moon\nNow every time I look at you\nFeels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, oh\nYou might also like[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]\nLiving in a dream\nWhere everybody loves me (Everybody loves me)\nLiving in a dream world\nHow'd I get so lucky? (How'd I get so)\nSo tell me how you feel\n\n[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle & Jesse Rutherford]\nUh, I feel like a legend in these Puma suedes\nI'ma still make millions when this music fade\nReinvent every time the music change\nMy gut had me feeling like I knew the way\nI feel like I spoke for my generation\nAll game and my demonstration\nTo my gang, I'm a different greatness\nPay dues, never missed a payment\nStay true, now it's entertainment\nFeel like I'm built for whatever storm\nWhatever way the game test me, in whatever form\nWar in dark times that they never saw\nI feel like I stand tall and can never fall (Yeah)\nI feel like a one on one (Alright)\nLike the last dope boy in the game with a hunnid tons (Yeah)\n2Pac got the troublesome\nA Boosie Badazz, drop a bag on you niggas if I want it done\n[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]\nLiving in a dream\nWhere everybody loves me (Everybody loves me)\nLiving in a dream world\nHow'd I get so lucky? (How'd I get so)\nSo tell me how you feel\n\n[Outro: Jesse Rutherford]\nNow the war is over\nCan't get any older\n20/20 vision31Embed"
