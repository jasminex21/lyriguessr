I could dissect you and\nGut you on this stage not as eloquent as I may have imagined\nBut it will get the job done, and you're\nDone...\nEvery line is plotted and designed to leave you\nStanding on your bedroom window's ledge\nAnd everyone else that it hits, that it gets to\nIs nothing more than collateral damage\n\n[Chorus]\nTake your taste back\nPeel back your skin\nAnd try to forget how it feels inside\nYou should try saying \"No\" once in a while, \"No\" once in a while\nTake your taste back\nPeel back your skin\nAnd try to forget how it feels inside\nYou should try saying \"No\" once in a while, \"No\" once in a while2Embed"
