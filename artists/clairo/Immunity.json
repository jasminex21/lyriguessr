I'm waiting for the right time\nI can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine\nCan you see me using everything to hold back?\nI guess this could be worse\nWalking out the door with your bags\nWalking out the door with your bags\nWalking out the door with your bags\nWalking out the door with your bags\n\n[Verse 2]\nPour your glass of wine\nMitchell told me I should be just fine (Yeah)\nCases under the bed\nSpill it open, let it rush to my head\nI don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners\nSavor this with everything I have inside of me\nI'm not the type to run\nI know that we're having fun\nBut what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed\nSee Clairo LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also like[Bridge]\nTell you how I felt\nSugar coated melting in your mouth\nPardon my emotions\nI should probably keep it all to myself\nKnow you'd make fun of me\nKnow you'd make fun of me\nKnow you'd make fun of me\nKnow you'd make fun of me\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you see me? I'm waiting for the right time\nI can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine\nCan you see me using everything to hold back?\nI guess this could be worse\nWalking out the door with your bags\nWalking out the door with your bags\nWalking out the door with your bags\nWalking out the door with your bags58Embed"

Is it my doing?
