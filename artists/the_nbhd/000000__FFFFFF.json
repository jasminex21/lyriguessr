Who's that?\"\nSmell my dick and asked last night where you was at\nSo if I lie now she'll probably find the truth later\nBut if I tell the truth she'll probably wanna leave the player\nAnd if she leave the player, who I'm gon' fuck with?\nCan't fuck with you cause you too comfortable being my side bitch\nBut fuck that, I told her\nDamn, that wasn't smart, damn, I fucked up\nNow that arguing 'bout to start\nShe like \"Who is this, did she suck yo dick?\nAlways that same way, YG, do you love this bitch?\nThis the same chick from last time, I saw you creepin' with\nYou took her out to eat and shit, ooh, I hate this bitch\"\nGoddamn, I gotta put an end to this triangle relationship\nI gotta stay away from you 'cause your pussy too dangerous\n\n[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]\nWe're made to love, we're made to love\nWe're made to love, we're made to love\n(Hey, but you, babe, you're dangerous!)\nBut you're dangerous, you're dangerous, (You're danger) you're dangerous\nFor both of us, you're dangerous17Embed"
