I can't feel it anymore\nIf ignorance is happiness, please, steal me from my head\n'Cause the voices once so soothing make me feel so fucking, so fucking dead\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'd give anything for something to feel anything at all\nIt just seems so goddamn meaningless, it all seems so devolved\nWe're drowning in irrelevance, we're hiding from the truth\nWe are the numb complacent, we are the broken youth\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat's left to say that hasn't been?\nWhat's left to say that hasn't been?\nWhat's left to say that hasn't been?\nWhat's left to say that hasn't been?\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are the numb, we are the broken youth\nWe come undone, we are the ugly truth\nWe are the numb, we are the broken youth\nWe come undone, we are the ugly truth\n\n[Bridge]\nI can't stop, I can't stop\nMedicated, sedated in the back seat of our lives\nIt's so fucking hard to swallow, will we make it out alive?\nI can't stop, I can't stop\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat's left to say that hasn't been?\nWhat's left to say that hasn't been?\nWhat's left to say that hasn't been?\nWhat's left to say that hasn't been?\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are the numb, we are the broken youth\nWe come undone, we are the ugly truth\nWe are the numb, we are the broken youth\nWe come undone, we are the ugly truthEmbed"
