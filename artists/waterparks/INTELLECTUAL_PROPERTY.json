Hello, I'm tryna meet ya\nShocked at the words comin' from my tongue\nA language that I'm not familiar, oh\nDon't take it away, I wanna play, where did the time fly?\nWhat if I pray? Hopin' you'll stay into the daylight\nWait, what am I sayin'? I feel insane\nIt's only been a couple days\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm havin' the same thoughts, can't stop\nThinkin' you've got me brainwashed\nI'm see-through, need you\nWhy do I think you're so cool?\nEverything's clean except for my thoughts (Yeah)\nThinkin' about me gettin' you off\nIt's been a week, I'm still at your house\nI don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, I don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out\nOh, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy am I actin' like that?\nMy day's fucked 'til you finally wanna text back\nI put some extra on my laugh when you say things\nAre you really that funny or am I hallucinatin'? Like\nI'm slippin' away, livin' the life, opened the floodgates\nGive me my space, give me your face at the same time\nIt's like my brain isn't mine, you moved into my mind\nDropped your bags, drew the blinds\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nNow I'm havin' the same thoughts, can't stop\nThinkin' you've got me brainwashed\nI'm see-through, need you\nWhy do I think you're so cool? (One, two, one, two, three, four)\nEverything's clean except for my thoughts (Yeah)\nThinkin' about me gettin' you off\nIt's been a week, I'm still at your house\nI don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, I don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out\nOh, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nThe syndrome feels Stockholm\nI'm like, \"Do you wanna keep me on lock though?\" Yeah\nSymmetrical feelings\nMatch best when we're starin' at the ceilin' (Yeah)\nThe syndrome feels Stockholm\nI'm like, \"Do you wanna keep me on lock though?\" Yeah\nSymmetrical feelings\nMatch best when we're starin' at the ceilin'\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm havin' the same thoughts, can't stop\nThinkin' you've got me brainwashed\nI'm see-through, need you\nWhy do I think you're so cool?\nEverything's clean except for my thoughts (Yeah)\nThinkin' about me gettin' you off (Gettin' you off)\nIt's been a week, I'm still at your house\nI don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, I don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out\nOh, oh3Embed"
