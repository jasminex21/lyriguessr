lyric,count
Mad all the time,14
"So let me go, let me go down",14
Last night I had the strangest dream of all,13
"Whoa, you’ll never know",12
Do you feel it too?,12
"Crave, crave, crave, crave, oh",12
"Love, love, love",12
"We, we're made in America",12
'Cause I like it,12
I really thought you were my four-leaf clover,12
"But I think it's fine, it's cool",11
I don't wanna be your crybaby,11
I don't wanna be your crybaby now,11
I wish I was royal but I'm not,11
I've got to know,10
Maybe someone's,10
Oh woah oh oh oh,10
You're one of my favorite few,10
Do you see the problem here?,9
I wish I was dead sometimes,9
But then what?,9
At least it's all about you,9
You rip me to shreds,9
I'm starting to think,8
Digging,8
Cause I'm just not used to,8
Break me,8
Teething,8
"Oh, tell me why we wonder",8
Was out to get you,8
"I want a big house, I want nice things",8
You know I'm stupid for you,8
I’m fighting for you,8
"Mad all the time, mad all the time",8
Deep through all my idols graves,7
Around the edge of my heart,7
"I'm cravin', a getaway from the",7
I think with my heart,7
Teething (teething),7
Keep me close like your territory now,7
And everybody wants you,7
I'm just here to destroy,7
"The heart I gave, it was a decoy",7
I'm better as your chew toy,7
I think the blondes are done,7
I never promised you your dream boy,7
We're fucked and don't care at all,7
My face feels hot and blue,7
We can fuck about it later if you want,7
If everyone you knew,6
It makes me sick you know my skin,6
We're all too cool for fun,6
"From thinking about, thinking about you all the time",6
Do you think God knows?,6
I'm magnetic to the things I hate the most,6
I-I'm mad all the time,6
Sleepin' with my clothes on in case shit goes wrong,6
You'd be paranoid too,6
"If you need me, I'm here now",6
Stay awake for me?,6
"Tell me, won't you stay awake",6
There's nothing in my system,6
Now I think I need a life or maybe 9,6
I could run away like that,6
So I'm feeling what I feel for you,6
'Cause I only want to lift you up,6
I guess I never really said enough,6
"We’re not sleeping, we’re just dreaming",6
I don't wanna be like that,6
I don't wanna think like that,6
"I like cool shirts, I like cold rings",6
I know I'm lonely but I won't come over,6
I try to hide with my words,6
You'd be worth the chases to go-oh-oh,6
Am I the boy you dreamed of? Oh,6
"What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yeah, yeah)",6
All the girls in Los Angeles look like you from a distance,6
"Yeah, everything slows down",6
"If you feel it, then I feel it too",6
Powerless tonight,6
All I am is losing track of time,6
It didn't work and I feel like shit,6
Tried anything not to think of ya,6
"Maybe I'm, maybe I'm tired (Maybe I'm, maybe I'm tired)",6
"Stop right there, don't come any closer",6
Just promise that you won’t forget about me,6
I found a million places,6
My quiet blue tomb,6
"Smooth talk, that's keeping me grounded",6
It's everything I wanted,6
"She wore a sweater in summer weather, yeah",6
And is it because of me?,6
I'm two faced from your double exposure,6
But one thing's for sure,6
Do you believe in love? Oh,6
Gotta clear my front lawn off,6
But you just find me clever,6
"To the, carpet in my room",6
Everybody just thinks that I’m falling apart at the seams and I can’t believe,5
That they’re all wrong about me,5
"Living in your subconscious, oh",5
Used to protect yourself from all the world,5
In my paradise,5
I’ll be the silver lining around your fence,5
When I was 15,5
Kiss me like nobody would,5
You're so cold,5
What made you so,5
Scared to be alone?,5
Who chilled your bones,5
That wasn't me,5
The boys are sad,5
Feeling my love mood,5
But can you really get lost in heaven?,5
We're classic hysteria,5
"We're culture clashing, hazard smashing",5
"Aesthetically, yeah, we're so pleasing",5
The size of my bad thoughts broke down my door,5
And everything slows down,5
Would you get tired of my time?,5
You dropped your guy and took me on,5
And love with my head,5
Maybe the end is near,5
Everything gets fuzzy when you come around,5
When I'm alone with you,5
And I’m just saying,5
And its sharp teeth,5
To keep you here with me,5
"She wore a sweater, it was funeral grey",5
When no one's watching you,5
And when I'm swallowed down,5
"I'd say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh",5
"I'd say it's for you, yeah, yeah, yeah",5
A night out on Earth,5
You've got me feeling like a walking love song,4
And all I think about is where you might be,4
"This isn't all, this isn't all it's cracked up to",4
My favorite set of stairs is the one up to your room,4
I never wanted to be thinking this loud,4
You know I'll always be around,4
I could live on a life raft next to you,4
"Ooh, ohh, I'll see you in the future, yeah, yeah, yeah",4
Sticks and stones may break my bones but:,4
You fuck with my head,4
I think the blondes are done with fun,4
"And I'm crying over it all, yeah",4
It's been a pleasure,4
To sleep or dream,4
I want jet packs for all my friends,4
"Getting out, getting",4
"While you follow around, around round round round",4
I'm fucked and hope you're proud,4
"Hey, look what you've done now",4
I was just doing the sane thing,4
Let's keep each other safe from the world,4
I'm highkey and lowkey as hell,4
And I just need you to feel it too,4
I'm like American graffiti,4
The la-la-la-lobotomy,4
Should've could’ve been the one,4
To turn everything around,4
That’s why I’m here,4
"Till we’re gone, whoa, whoa, whoa",4
I'm sitting here delirious,4
It's nice to meet you,4
I don't feel lucky in here,4
So keep me close like your territory,4
"'Cause you, you don't seem to like it when we talk",4
"I guess I'll see you later, see you later, yeah",4
Or I need it over,4
Writer's block has building blocks,4
And built these walls around me,4
Buried in my head,4
It's such a fucking shame,4
I'm seeing red and nothing else,4
I-I-I'm mad all the time,4
Like you'd even want to,4
Can't stop me right now,4
'Cause my open hand and heart think you belong with me,4
Drop it right now,4
Simple steps are all it takes,4
Keep me close and we won't get boring,4
"Baby, search and then destroy me",4
Do you wanna be my territory?,4
But steps don’t erase mistakes,4
Hand it off to me,4
"Yeah, you cloud my",4
"Yeah, you cloud my head",4
"‘Cause when you’re lost, you’re found; you’re gone",4
We expect everything,4
And expect nothing less,4
I don't wanna talk about it,4
"Yeah, everything slows down my 24",4
I wish I could forget you (Forget you),4
I went out with my two best friends,4
"Tell me why, oh, oh",4
"Float my way, I'm melting for you",4
You don't love me the same,4
These daydreams are day seeds,4
Now I'm kinda thinking that I'll never bloom again,4
"It's turbulent, turbulent",4
In the dark between my sheets,4
Now I'm mad about—I don't know what,4
Shake me up and watch me in my—,4
Lose it where your head should be,4
Just like I told you so,4
"I'd unfuck you if I could, ooh, ooh, ooh",4
I'd unlove you like I should have,4
You're the reason I can't sleep?,4
Do you see,4
"Us giving up, living down",4
So fuck yourself and fuck your feelings,4
Months before I did,4
I’ve been living dark,4
In the months before I split,4
I tried to give you space until I stepped away from your brain and now I just miss it,4
All of the above when I'm alone,4
What's up,4
What we were thinking all along,4
"I, I, I",4
"Fuck you and your friends and LA, you know I mean that",4
So delete us from your phone and never look back,4
I’m just waiting,4
So learn these fucking words,4
So I'll just tell my telephone,4
But only on your terms,4
You wanna hear my art,4
"I believe, but not in you and me, so",4
And this ain’t Misery,3
That I don't hear from my friends anymore,3
"I'm on my way to you, but I self-sabotage",3
"To get away from you, I'll self-sabotage",3
(In my paradise),3
And the way you tease is unfair,3
"So I might drive my car and crash into your garage, ooh",3
What the fuck is wrong with me?,3
"If you like when we talk, I'll dislocate my jaw, ooh",3
My inner child needs a bulletproof vest and a phone that can't text,3
And twenty years rest,3
"Build a bomb shelter, bite a belt for the stress",3
"I've got some dirty laundry, can you keep it?",3
"“Boy, I know you’re in there",3
And I think that's pretty cool,3
I miss having sex but at least I don't wanna die anymore,3
"If you believe me, I could be your truth",3
'Cause your moonlit backseat always leaves me,3
My mood's dictated by our conversations,3
Alone was never easy after you,3
"'Cause this is what you've done, you've done to me",3
Thinkin' you've got me brainwashed,3
"I'm see-through, need you",3
Everything's clean except for my thoughts (Yeah),3
"It's been a week, I'm still at your house",3
"I don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out",3
"Oh, I don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out",3
"Oh, oh",3
You never really missed me back,3
You're the only one that makes me,3
So when are you gonna sing for me?,3
Wake up tomorrow and try again,3
My panic’s at the ceiling,3
And keeps me,3
Somewhere inside the softest part of my mind,3
But I'm flat down on the carpet,3
I said I loved you to death,3
On the door of my apartment,3
And you put away your halo,3
‘Cause there’s no way he’s just letting,3
You fall from the stars,3
"(I'm thinking off the page, and I can't sleep)",3
"I'm thinking off the page, and I can't sleep",3
"Captured, I was stuck in place",3
I'm over all the stale days,3
And get in my car,3
Go to my place,3
I settled for these scribbled lines,3
I can't even count the times,3
You’ve been sneaking out of heaven?,3
I wanna lose my mood inside a late night phone call with you,3
"What do I, I do?",3
They see me from the halls,3
And I,3
Don't know just what they want,3
So small I wanna,3
From outer space the street looks small,3
The times I'm feeling far from home,3
I'll watch you from my telescope,3
"But it's better than nothing, yeah, I know",3
I barely get more than a glimpse,3
Like were his eyes closed?,3
"My freckles and my hands, you know",3
You’ve been sneaking out of heaven,3
"You know, so I must be dead",3
Next to your favorite songs,3
So I stay in,3
"I want you all to myself this time, t-t-time",3
I wanna live inside your mind,3
I wanna make my way into your kiss,3
It's all we ever really do when something's wrong,3
So I must be dead,3
Because we never fix the problems that we've got,3
You only like me when I'm numb,3
The best is hard to grip when everybody wants you,3
I'll take what I can get,3
"You're a symphony, I'm just a sour note",3
I wear you like a halo,3
You're playing ring around my head,3
But I don't know how,3
"Hey, tell me what you want me to say",3
The boys are back,3
Because I love you or I want to,3
I need you closer,3
My sins are all built in,3
Either need you closer,3
And if you don't text I get too frustrated,3
I don't deserve as much,3
Conflicted looks good on me,3
"You're my final destination, I know",3
"My tired thoughts don't take vacations, oh no",3
So let me tell you now,3
For you to hear me where you are,3
Hahaaaaa just kidding,3
Looking like a Sunday,3
Everybody goes home alone,3
"That's got me sitting, wishing, waiting for your call",3
But Cupid sent me on a mission,3
I know you said to mind my business,3
I'm leaving you love notes in the kitchen that say it all,3
To the one I call my missus,3
"Happy birthday, Merry Christmas",3
In the back of the deep end,3
"Oh-oh, oh-oh",3
I found you just in time,3
"It's too easy to hate you, and hard to love",3
Except the shots I take and phone calls from you,3
There's nothing left to miss,3
But I'm nervous at my central for you,3
I'm sweating out potential,3
Wishing for a someday,3
"You float up in conversations, oh no",3
You're probably fine there,3
"I really thought that I was lucky, fuck me",3
Just know I think you're rare,3
"(’Cause we’re living, we’re living, we’re living, we’re living)",3
You know I'd die for you,3
Cherry red,3
I'll watch you from my telescope;,3
"You won't ever have to sleep, sleep, sleep alone",3
"You can call me on my phone, I'll come to you",3
You won't ever have to sleep alone,3
"You can call me on my phone, I'll run to you",3
"(Forget it, forget it, forgive it, forget it)",3
You're the blueprint to my stupid sounds,3
"You're the lucid, plain view Cupid found",3
So I wouldn't have to check my phone,3
So I could spend a day alone,3
And not feel like everybody hates me,3
Loud gets lonely,3
"(If life is just a game, then I’mma flip the board and break the peace)",3
Now it’s 3 AM,3
To uninspired's lacking symmetry,3
It's turned my starry friends,3
With a part of me that's hard to see,3
I resent the party scene,3
"'Cause I feel like I’m running out of time, yea",3
Someday maybe on a Sunday,3
I'm trying desperately,3
So why do I feel invested?,3
"7 PM, let it sink in",3
I can be your best yet,3
Future favorite regret,3
I must've caught you from 11:11,3
Evil comes in pairs and we like what we do,3
I'd never I'd never I'd never get you off my mind,3
All I need is more time right now,3
"But if you wanted, I'd never I'd never I'd never leave your leave your side",3
Because the world's gonna pass me by,3
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave you hanging out to dry,3
Lose your mind,3
And you'll be sorry when you come to,3
"Yeah, I'm like you without good moods",3
My cave's my room where I'll cave too,3
"See, I'm like you without good moods and",3
As all your pop faves,3
It freaks me out,3
But I’d break your knees,3
'Cause then what?,3
And now it's killing me,3
"Want you all to myself this time, t-t-time",3
From 7-Elevens to California Heavens,3
I know we only just met,3
I can sit and sun bathe,3
But I'll just stay alone because alone is safer than with you,3
I really thought that I was lucky (I was lucky),3
'Cause I’m feeling like I’m running out of time,3
"It's too easy to hate you, when was enough?",3
At least I thought you did,3
'Cause you shine brighter than morning,3
"Let me go, let me go down",3
I'm a little bitch for you now,3
"It's too easy to hate you, hate you",3
You deserve a couple bad hair days,3
You're hard to love,3
"I'd love to be in love with you enough to write a love song, mmh",3
I need to feel needed and I need it more than I let on,3
You...,3
Shake from the fact she's my world devastator,3
"I'll be home just thinking about it, maybe call like I used to",3
No plastic or paper can take her or make her,3
And I hope that your car's AC breaks,3
I'd like it if you cracked your phone screen,3
But I'd like it even more if you called me,3
"Yeah, I like it",3
"Yeah, you said it:",3
My eyes stuck to my favorite show,3
"Yeah-ah-ah-ah, you've been sneaking out of heaven",3
But I can change the way it feels,3
The action's a fraction,3
"Oh, it's like I told you",3
Of you (Of you),3
Someone will come to replace me along with the dreams I’ve got,3
Now,3
Yeah,3
If there's a place right now,3
There's a way somehow,3
It's like I told you,3
And that's where I've gotta,3
"Oh, when this was too far",3
(What happens next?) I guess we’ll never know,3
I won’t sell myself out,3
I won’t let you down,3
Can’t stop the future from settling,3
If your indigo eyes are mine,3
I feel,3
"And make these modern days seem small, but",3
This time I’ll do things the way you wanted,3
"It’s not right, but it’s just the way you want it",3
"Lay it all on me, ‘cause I’m all ears",3
Dream scenes of,3
"This isn't all, this isn't all it's cracked up to be",3
Just like you never wanted to,3
Oh,3
Still I’m fighting; still I’m fighting for you,3
Through all these inconsistencies,3
Of you,3
And I just gotta know,3
One of these days,3
Call it new wave,3
Cause one thing's for sure,3
I can't imagine fast enough to settle on a dream,3
But I've spent this winter wondering when they're gonna settle on me,3
And there's some things I've just gotta know,3
Nothing said has come so easy,3
Like nothing ever happened,2
And I don't hear from my friends anymore,2
I don't invite the head rush,2
But I'm still just me,2
I've spent some years rewinding,2
So tear into me,2
The city is insidious,2
We live in chemistry away from all the wasted time and taste,2
That they all changed you into”,2
"Into, into, into, oh",2
Why do I think you're so cool?,2
In my jacket pocket,2
My tiny little world is in your hands,2
I'm not scared of anything,2
But it follows me,2
"I'm havin' the same thoughts, can't stop",2
This city is insidious,2
So shake it like a snow globe,2
I just want you to be my next mistake that I'm gonna make (Oh),2
I can't explain the look on her face,2
Of how much this hurts,2
“They hate everything,2
Give back my halo you stole,2
Miles of aisles,2
Before we're in the dirt?,2
Is this what we deserve,2
And everyone's freakin' me out (Woo),2
"I wake up and I'm up and I'm down (Up, up, up)",2
"Yo, shut the fuck out of your mouth",2
Give back my breath that you hold,2
This is the part where you get a job,2
This is the part where you settle for less,2
It's silver and cold,2
It gets real fuckin' dark,2
"And then she walked away, I didn't get her name",2
This is not the part where you cut your losses,2
This is not the part where you get a job,2
Sunbathe,2
Or will they always follow me?,2
The fingers pointing the blame,2
Can we stand to break,2
I'm missing your breath,2
"""People miss the old you”",2
I've fallen apart,2
So tear into my heart,2
Thinkin' about me gettin' you off,2
"That “Today, not tomorrow, is ours.”",2
Fuck my plans,2
"Wake up tomorrow and try again, yeah",2
It buries all my problems,2
I like how your hair smells,2
But I like your apartment,2
To call when you're out every night,2
While I'm dipping my toes in the silence,2
"Show me your, show me your violence",2
"Yeah, I'm sick of playin' it cool",2
"When, baby, really I, I wanna die",2
So I went out with my two best friends,2
"If you need me, all I need is you",2
So get the fuck back,2
We're building sandcastles out from their ashes now,2
"These copy cats are getting, getting feral now",2
This is not the part where you settle for less,2
Making plans on another planet daily lately,2
Less slow verbs,2
When are you gonna drink for me?,2
"I miss seeing the red on your face when I made you blush, hey",2
"I don't know, I don't know",2
Ruinin' me completely,2
Until I forget the details,2
I said I'm stealing rock back,2
Let's try words,2
"I guess you messed me up, I'll pay for this",2
"It's true, ooh, ooh",2
Instead of tying our breath in knots again,2
I wish I could forget you,2
But it's out of hand,2
You're chopping it down in heavy seconds,2
Do you feel it? 'Cause I feel it too,2
"(I don’t have the sympathy, I think that you need more from me)",2
You're not alone 'til it stings like this,2
I'll fake asleep until I'm dreaming,2
"Tell me why oh, oh",2
So take off with your snapback,2
I would swim if it keeps me close to you,2
The syndrome feels Stockholm,2
"I'm like, ""Do you wanna keep me on lock though?"" Yeah",2
Symmetrical feelings,2
So check out all the love I get,2
I ripped into you with on Black Light,2
I've still got the spite,2
I've still got the fangs,2
Before you get knocked flat,2
Filled up with files of titles,2
That I think that I love you so,2
If you fall I'll swim right back to you,2
I've been building this island every day,2
It’s just you and me,2
"Wake up, good morning",2
I think you saved my life,2
My love's distorted,2
Little did you know,2
But what's important,2
My shirt's imported,2
I pray for more shit,2
Like that would help me,2
To feel more free,2
I left another seed,2
And little did you know,2
That’s how it’s gotta be,2
But I'm a little bitch for you now,2
I don't wanna say it way too loud,2
"""I'll be something you're not""",2
It's true,2
Just to flex on me,2
I couldn't get much sleep,2
All you gotta do is stop texting me,2
So desperately,2
Acting so desperately,2
If you want to see me,2
I carried you down the stairs every day,2
"Ooh, you",2
It’s like the way you move,2
Soon everyone will be gone,2
An afternoon just to breathe,2
Don't trust nobody else,2
Like every single second's just another second spent to lose,2
But I'll tell you:,2
"Nothing, nothing good comes from late night thinking",2
Banging in my head like bap-bap-bap-bap,2
"Feelings in the light go bad, bad, bad, bad",2
"Headlights in my eyes go black, black, black, black",2
"It's bad, bad, bad, bad",2
Teasing on myself like na-na-na-na,2
I wasn't prepared,2
You know I think you're rare,2
"Driving slow, yeah, I'm losing myself",2
It's 'cause,2
"Let's be lucky people, you and me",2
(To try something that the rest have never seen),2
My hands still count on you to let me down,2
Articulate and lonely enough for the two of us,2
I just hope it's nicer where you are,2
"If you want, if you want, if you want to",2
If there's a chance we'll sink then I don't even wanna try,2
"'Cause we're not seventeen, but you're my teenage dream",2
So practice your passion on me,2
Give me your 100 degrees,2
I'll die off whenever you need,2
"Ooh, ooh, ooh",2
'Cause now it's far too hard to see through,2
I wish you didn't tell me I was special,2
Your mama likes me and she doesn't like anyone,2
It's nice to meet you ('Cause what you give out's what you get back),2
And tangle myself up in the knots,2
I could invent a thousand problems,2
About everything I’m not?,2
Would it be worth it to write songs,2
"Taking notes, yeah, write it down",2
"Yeah, you've been seeing all about me",2
"You want some glitter, drink it down",2
This is the part where you cut your losses,2
And my heavy set of cares evaporates all around you,2
"Yeah, you've been reading all about me",2
"It's been a pleasure (So destroy my world, I'll tape the cracks)",2
"It's been a pleasure (I'll stop the world, I'll tape the cracks)",2
And my empty set of cares evaporates all around you,2
It's nice to meet you (What you give out's what you get back),2
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave you out to dry,2
"Your everything, everything",2
'Cause I'm dying to be,2
I've gotta let you know,2
You could be my only one,2
There's something I haven't told before,2
Describing how much this hurts?,2
So I'll just live on this island until I break,2
"Every day, I'm more numb to the Sad Game",2
Waiting for the right time to get away,2
The lucky number seven,2
All that I can do is fall in blame with you,2
The lo-lo-lo-lobotomy,2
"Yeah, if it's up to me, say it all",2
"Yeah, I'm a little bit of a little bitch, so?",2
"Let me go, let me go",2
It took all but you,2
"Mind, your head, has lost its sight",2
"Yeah‚ if it's up to me, say it all",2
"Has taken all of, all of me",2
"Mind your head, I've lost my mind",2
"Ooh, ohh, you can find me in the rumours, yeah, yeah, yeah",2
If you could see the things,2
That I see when I sleep,2
Then you'd be paranoid like me,2
I used to save the words you said,2
Hands in my pockets,2
In the texts that you would send when you were going to bed,2
It's like you were yellow but the lights were red,2
You're selfish and a half,2
For what I've been planning,2
"And worth it, so hold on",2
And the other half is me,2
While they're just finding me out,2
"I wanted privacy, routine and everything between",2
"I never asked about the when, why or how",2
Who's apparently not mad enough,2
To get up and to leave,2
I wanna go home,2
Typical story,2
I love it all,2
"Baby, you don't seem to like it when we talk",2
I built a secret room for you,2
"Tell me, are we far gone?",2
But I'd break your knees,2
"And how I know, I know it's coming soon",2
"Tell me, will we fall off?",2
Step into the good light,2
But all that means is a new beginning,2
And all it meant was a new beginning,2
"Think you're the worst of them, think you're the worst",2
"Think you're the worst of them, think you're the worst of them all",2
"You diva, I just wanna see ya",2
"You sweetheart, don't wanna be apart",2
But all that means is,2
But I'mma knock 'em down down down like,2
You say,2
"Self-care, green hair, looking cute today",2
Hello to the FANDOM,2
Now you’re looking through the peephole,2
"Hey, can you come and come out and play?",2
Break your knees,2
"To keep you here with me (yeah)""",2
Just one more chance to adore you,2
I see shadows on my walls,2
But your middle one's up,2
"I've had enough, I try to brush it off",2
'Cause you're my confidante,2
"So let's talk, share secrets",2
"I'll take you with me, we can ride",2
I’ll be your silver lining,2
Because I need to really feel you,2
But we're runnin' around,2
Is it easy now?,2
"Tell me, are we all wrong?",2
You only hit me in the evenin',2
When I'm all stressed out,2
My brain just needs a little bit of cleaning,2
(Yeah-ah-ah),2
(Yeah-ah-ah-ah),2
"You know what I mean, man",2
All wrong,2
That’s what it comes down to,2
You do it without words,2
Like when you lead me back to your place,2
It's a night out on Earth,2
Either way I'm in the conversation,2
Straight up to my window,2
I ain't jumpin' out the window,2
I'm just saying,2
I-I-I,2
You're either dying,2
Or you're playing,2
I'm tired all the time,2
I'm cutting my own line,2
(Woo!),2
Step into the moonlight,2
So spin the bottle in your brain,2
With titles that don't match at all,2
I like happy songs,2
All I know is that this isn't love,2
Do you see?,2
All I know is that this isn't fun,2
"You're the reason I can't sleep (Oh, oh)",2
Lose it where your head should be (Oh),2
Why do I got both my hands up praying?,2
Now I feel like that's all old news,2
You love me in such weird ways,2
I brought my words to a fistfight,2
But I watch you when you’re walking,2
Please don't have a TANTRUM,2
'Cause I think you're the worst of them,2
I brought my hell to you,2
A hurricane lives in my bedroom,2
It keeps me up and awake for round two,2
And I just wanna sleep,2
But that's all too much,2
I brought a knife to a gunfight,2
(You only like me when I'm numb),2
On my ceiling,2
The end wasn’t ours to fear,2
It's like a bad day in new shoes,2
And I was saying,2
I was waiting,2
And the worst part of it is,2
A long weekend with curfews,2
You freak me out,2
Is the ring around your finger,2
"Or I need it over, yeah",2
The more I wrap myself up,2
Climb the walls of my headroom,2
I feel most safe in my bedroom,2
Entirely both know this,2
My brains and my hands,2
Will never let me focus,2
But it starts to mean nothing,2
But I can't stay lost forever,2
"I want a big house, but I'm hiding",2
We are both like that,2
I think I talk too much,2
So I’ll leave them buried in the details,2
I try to walk it off,2
But now you got your gloves,2
I don't wanna leave you hangin' on,2
And now you box me out,2
We are both the same,2
And I can't wait to go outside,2
So keep out of my room,2
So tell me something,2
My heart is shut from you,2
We are not like that,2
We are not the same,2
No,2
And I still don't know,2
And I looked but I can't pretend,2
And I think and I think and I think about the end,2
Livin' like I'm dead and on my own,2
"With all the things you don't say, I'm livin' fuckin' betrayed",2
Are you hearin' me when I say you're bleedin' me out?,2
If you need me now,2
And spend my summers contemplating what I'm gonna do with my life,2
"Don't look for me, don't look for me",2
I'll be there somehow,2
I could sleep for weeks and speak in Z's,2
"I'll pick you up, we can ride",2
"Never know what's next, next",2
You're killin' me when I'm fast asleep,2
Anything but nothing,2
I'll fly away like I bought my own airline,2
I won't slow my pace until your walkway,2
My sneezing fits,2
Show me everything I want,2
I don't wanna think about it,2
I'm out the ring,2
Because the last time that,2
I had these thoughts,2
"Mirror, mirror, on the wall",2
I just kept going on about it,2
Life is slow paced,2
"“Everybody hates you""",2
But the only ring I want,2
"Give me three days, three days alone, yeah",2
"Still I’m fighting, still I’m fighting for you",2
Context clues don’t do much for you,2
"I guess I'll see you later, see you later",2
"Yeah, I'm a little bit of a little bitch, so? (So?)",1
(If everyone was out to get you),1
"Find out that I'm canceled, shit",1
"I'm singing in 3/4, that's how you know I'm fucking making this shit nice",1
"Had to have a Britney moment, and I cut it off",1
Do I do this for a living or a death?,1
Light a couple candles,1
In case you're scared of the movies I pick,1
Might just rent a hotel room,1
(Ummmm),1
If everyone you knеw,1
Right 'round my shoulders,1
"Yea, you can wrap your arms so tight",1
You'd bе paranoid too,1
I got some Fruit By The Foot if you wanna come over,1
Cut it off,1
"I might turn around and say some stupid shit, no (Uh)",1
I feel cursed on tour with a big smile on,1
You'd be paranoid too (You'd be paranoid too),1
"I might turn around and say some stupid shit, no (So?)",1
Make them fight to the death,1
If everyone you knew (If everyone that you knew was out to get you),1
As much as they would give me at the CVS,1
And what it comes back to is gladiators,1
I'm sorry in advance for that shit,1
I might just lose my shit hop off the balcony,1
Room 103,1
You think about themes of the album,1
I'd like it if you cracked your phone screen (ba-da-da ba-da-da),1
"Yeah, that's my purgatory",1
My Plan B,1
And I hope that your car's AC breaks (bitch),1
You think about themes of the tour that's upcoming,1
"Yeah, until I end it all (Shit)",1
"Whoops, I got a little dark",1
"Yeah, things get a little hard",1
But I was,1
When you've got eyes in my closet,1
Then you can tell them that I wasn't sober,1
And if they're mad at this,1
But I bought a bunch of candy,1
 from fucking us over,1
"Had to have a Britney moment, had to cut it off",1
Like me stopping ,1
"Where instead of being creative, I'm making business decisions",1
"I got what I wanted, or at least I thought",1
"It's like, I wanna get away but I'm put in these situations",1
But their eyes probably rolled at the first line (Fuck 'em),1
You think about new music that might be worked on,1
What would you say is going to be the next colour of your hair?,1
"They say it's not true, and they hope I'm alright",1
I'm gonna shave my fucking head!,1
You only like me whеn I'm numb,1
How far could it get without me?,1
"I might turn around and say some stupid shit, no",1
Cause if this here ain’t a stick up,1
"But if I put it in a song, that shit goes hard as hell",1
When you talk,1
(ooo),1
Look who stopped by,1
We're backstage in London today,1
I pulled my headphones out,1
And I combat how the pressure feels,1
I should call my parents more just to say that I'ma be okay,1
Some things weren’t meant to fall,1
Oh shoot,1
(Did it work?),1
(I bought these paintings to impress you),1
(Or maybe a hook),1
So they don't worry every day,1
"I haven't slept in days, but who's counting?",1
(I could freestyle you a verse),1
Did I say that too loud?,1
Oh my God,1
It's only Waterparks,1
How are you guys?,1
It's me!,1
When I'm getting up the guts to say that,1
I can't tweet that I wanna kill myself,1
How the hell did I end up in Hell right next to you?,1
I'll probably die in my apartment I couldn't afford last year,1
"(Yeah, come on)",1
My Drake problems sound thoughtless,1
But it's all brand new and I promise I'm being really honest,1
I haven't had a day off since my blue hair,1
I don't tell you how to wake up and be a dumb bitch every day,1
But instead I'm in a straitjacket in my room,1
I wanna win a Grammy in a suit,1
Or speak my truth,1
Instead of trying to explain how I should do my job,1
"No, my whole freeway",1
So how about you stay out of my lane?,1
I'm a little bitch,1
Oh it's true,1
When no one’s watching you,1
The way you brave all the bullshit I hold inside,1
Be depressed to death,1
And living on vacation?,1
I'll divide my time,1
"Between Me, Myself, and I",1
So what the fuck is up?,1
And all my expectations,1
"Cause, motherfucker, I look good today",1
I think I'm halfway there but my heart feels off so,1
It took a second to admit but I’m finally coming clean,1
And I love those,1
It's like that shit was written in gel pen,1
A modern boy’s best friend is his machine,1
About me,1
And it's nicer than anything I'd believe,1
It's in cursive to me,1
While sometimes,1
And your favorite constellation?,1
I bought thesе really sick lights if you wanna come over,1
They both can change colors,1
But for you I'd brave all the traffic outside,1
Full of Pacific Cooler,1
With my refrigerator,1
'Cause in here I'm the ruler,1
I don't wanna leave my house,1
Like that,1
But look,1
How can I be a black hole,1
Thеy tried to scam me twice,1
What keeps me awake at night is understanding,1
I want a brain that doesn't hate me,1
I wanna see my stupid fucking friends daily,1
But I'd like it even more if you called mе,1
You deserve a couplе bad hair days,1
What's the point of being great if I'm great and alone?,1
And you’re loving what you found,1
"I'm breathing, I'm drowning",1
That's all I can talk about without hurting your feelings,1
You can't kill what you can't see,1
"Plan C, Plan D",1
But what they hand me,1
"Mental, physical, it's cyclical",1
I'm numb but still I'm hurting,1
She said,1
"Plan A, Plan B",1
And watch the worst of me escape,1
Boy I'm not a stalker,1
But the whole time the gladiator wasn't fighting 'cause he liked fighting,1
"But I watch you when you're walking""",1
"(""Break your knees",1
"To keep you here with me"")",1
"""You call all kinds of people who aren't me""",1
I'm not leaving any signs,1
Like the kind you think you find,1
"Good morning, why’d you wake me",1
When I haven’t slept much lately?,1
I was having that same old dream again,1
I'll take on every little thing you hand me,1
It's fake and doesn't happen at all,1
If you look then you could see inside (inside),1
Looking through the peephole,1
But it’s about me,1
And just to be clear,1
Then we could write some songs,1
And waste some hours talking shit,1
We'd both hate the same things,1
Then I will make best friends with it,1
First I'd find my evil twin,1
"I mean the show, you’re Joe",1
“Boy I’m not a stalker,1
And travel to another plane,1
Increase my pace and hop the gate,1
You call all kinds of people who aren’t me (yeah),1
I wish my brain could sneak away,1
When I fall asleep at night,1
And Repeat,1
Not far away,1
"(He's just joking, it's alright)",1
"Making plans on another planet daily, lately",1
"But don’t you worry 'cause I heard—""",1
The one they finally took my head and win,1
"Shallow, not too far away (not far)",1
Alone but surrounded,1
And every year becomes who I've always feared,1
This is the soundtrack to us giving up,1
"(Yeah, yeah, uh)",1
Evil things I say like,1
In the back of thе deep end,1
And quiet all the,1
I get to debate myself,1
In the day time,1
"7PM, Let it sink in",1
"For good, for good",1
When my heart is shut from you,1
“I love you so much”,1
’Cause all I hear is,1
Everybody goes homе alone,1
"In the daytime, I get to debate myself",1
Can you fix me?,1
So good morning,1
I’ve been dead since 2016,1
"Yeah, yeah, uh",1
And quiet all the evil things I say like,1
"Living down, getting out, getting",1
"Us giving up, living down (I don’t have the sympathy, I think that you need more from me)",1
I buried all my pain today,1
Now it's 3 AM,1
It’s fake and doesn't happen at all,1
Without hurting your feelings,1
That's all I can talk about,1
’Cause all I hear is “I love you so much”,1
To watch the worst of me escape,1
It's clear so I can see inside,1
I wrapped the box in cellophane,1
I packaged up my pain today,1
When my heart is shut,1
From you,1
I wrote down the soundtrack of giving up,1
And the songs go like this,1
On my Greatest Hits,1
Just like I never wanted to,1
I've got a lot to say but words are getting old,1
As the seasons change and my future folds,1
I can't bring myself to celebrate the new year,1
"Getting out, getting out",1
"Uh-huh, oh, it’s love, yeah",1
Joel would be impressed,1
We complete each other's lines,1
Because our stupid brains connect,1
Because you hate to laugh,1
"But motherfucker, I look good today",1
Cause if this here ain’t a stickup,1
Around the world ’till it stops,1
"I’ll pack a suitcase, follow if you want",1
So I'm not leaving bed 'till Friday night,1
Nothing in this world can make me think straight,1
The more I'm coming undone,1
Then I woke up and I had a thought,1
Do you see me now?,1
"Because it feels so, so far away",1
Maybe I should try to live one normal day,1
If all I'm here to do is relate,1
"""If you read this, it’s your fault""",1
I'll write it on the wall:,1
But I could ruin mine by Monday,1
Maybe the world was made in 6 days,1
And someday I will Sunbathe,1
Away from anyone and everyone,1
Live a secret life for fun,1
You're too cool for me,1
Or the jokes I make,1
But because of that,1
I had therapy on Wednesdays,1
Thе more I'm coming undone,1
If I left my body for so long,1
My band and I are like Coldplay,1
That's allowed to say the fuck word,1
And you,1
I learned to live with these eyes in my closet,1
You're like,1
'Cause I still use straws on the down-low (I'm sorry),1
"I can't say that they're all wrong, though",1
"But I don't text when I drive, though (Nice)",1
People treat me like I'm an asshole,1
The biggest scummy bummy dummy ugly motherfucker,1
And you're loving what you found,1
"Lucky for me, I don’t need a lot",1
Cause you can't look past caps,1
Usually I'm all I've got,1
Since it came unchained the other day,1
So here’s an x-ray of what's in my brain,1
But haven't been in months,1
I keep my eyes wide shut,1
Until I’m fine,1
So I’ll dissociate until I’m fine,1
Real life never feels like it’s mine,1
My solar eyes grow polarized,1
We’ve got the same sunglasses on,1
Jump face-first into the sun,1
And parachutes for my escape,1
"Yeah, it might take a couple planes",1
"Nirvana, but it's far away",1
I've seen a place I'd like to stay,1
(One more time; let’s work this out),1
Woke up and it was August,1
Never wanted to,1
(One more time; I’ve got this down),1
I fell asleep last Winter,1
Goddamn,1
And we both would need a nap,1
Alone on my couch,1
Watching Netflix again,1
"It’s like I’m watching ""You""",1
At approximately the same time,1
Our serotonin would crash,1
But the blinding light is so much fun,1
Maybe paradise,1
Is somewhere deep inside,1
Where I feel alright,1
Do you have my PIN?,1
I feel like I’m running out of time,1
The secret life of me,1
‘Cause I never wanna leave the secret life of me,1
"No, I don’t know how",1
You’ll show up or when,1
But it freaks me out,1
You say “Boy I’m not a stalker,1
You call all kinds of people who aren’t me,1
"Not much has changed, yeah, I still feel the same",1
"But don’t you worry ‘cause I heard everything.""",1
I had a dream last night,1
"So sit, shut up and let me t-t-t-talk",1
There’s not much time,1
Building my whole life,1
Where I've spent all my time,1
The halls or walls,1
But I’m slowly making progress,1
And they would cheer on a gladiator,1
And blame it when I lose my sight,1
He wasn't fighting because he- of anything else,1
'Cause I love you or I want to,1
Like a ritual,1
They're killin' me when I'm fast asleep,1
Melatonin eyes feel heavy tonight,1
Like a ritual (Yeah),1
Thеy're killin' me when I'm fast asleep,1
Melatonin eyes feel hеavy tonight,1
"If anyone cares, I’m the voice of reason",1
If I bottle up a monster,1
"It only grows, grows, grows",1
"Then why should I expect it gone 'fore I’m bones, bones, bones",1
"Well, I guess you just have to be prepared to die",1
What if I want to have sex before I get married?,1
'Cause you put on makeup and I'm still in bed,1
And then I'll be upset when you're mad for the day,1
Make plans and break them to see what you say,1
"But I want what I can't havе, no",1
I want this to work so bad,1
"And your reason's not good enough, no, no",1
I'll piss you off and ask what's wrong,1
"What the fuck is wrong with me? (Yеah, yeah)",1
I’m bones,1
"(When you’re lost, you’re found; you’re gone",1
"When you’re lost, you’re found; you’re gone)",1
So kids like me can find them,1
Men like me transcribe them,1
Save your futures and save yourselves,1
Now we're at the part where you'll hate what you see,1
"(Eight, seven, six, five, four, three)",1
Never know what's next,1
"Yeah, woo",1
You've been doin' silly things like checkin' who I follow,1
So I contemplate the change,1
"I feel love a different way, yeah",1
Nothin' stays the same,1
"Baby, you don't seem like it when we talk",1
"I guess I'll see you later, see you later (Yeah)",1
It's all we ever really do when something's wrong (When something's wrong),1
But it's kinda hard to miss who's never gone,1
"That we did to one another, baby",1
It's like scars on my wrist when I think about the shit,1
"But sometimes, when we fight",1
"And it's all right, I won't lie to you",1
"I know you waitin' by the phone, but I just wanna be all alone tonight",1
You've been at my crib for like the seventh day up in a row,1
(Shut the fuck up),1
(It's all about what can happen when you lose),1
Still I’m fighting and I’ll just keep trying ‘till it's,1
It’s all about what can’t happen when you lose,1
"But when we fight, it's like a marathon",1
I hate the aftertaste,1
It doesn't always stay that way,1
Been givin' me your attitude,1
"I like you, but I need some room",1
Lookin' at your face,1
It's not hard to kill a day,1
I like you kinda far away,1
"I like you, but I need some space",1
Better than I was before you and me,1
"It's avoidable, I'll destroy chances to be",1
"When you need me most, I'll miss that flight",1
Thinkin' about me gettin' you off (Gettin' you off),1
So now I'm solo when the night's cold,1
You treated my heart like a handbag,1
You hit back with the syntax,1
But dangerous and matters to me,1
Simple steps are all we need,1
To dig up these rotten seeds,1
That are here to sing,1
Now I'm sick of waitin' on you,1
I coulda picked your body in a lineup,1
"Yeah, with the blinds drawn and the lights off",1
But I don't know where to go when the night's long,1
I'm tryin' to turn my mind off,1
Match best when we're starin' at the ceilin',1
You know I'm sick of waitin' on you,1
Match best when we're starin' at the ceilin' (Yeah),1
"Why do I think you're so cool? (One, two, one, two, three, four)",1
"Now I'm havin' the same thoughts, can't stop",1
"Dropped your bags, drew the blinds",1
"It's like my brain isn't mine, you moved into my mind",1
"Give me my space, give me your face at the same time",1
"I'm slippin' away, livin' the life, opened the floodgates",1
Are you really that funny or am I hallucinatin'? Like,1
I put some extra on my laugh when you say things,1
My day's fucked 'til you finally wanna text back,1
Why am I actin' like that?,1
My head’s still rich,1
"Yeah, I kissed a couple people, but they taste wrong",1
Wake up tomorrow and try again (Woo),1
Might unplug my phone at night,1
Now I'm checkin' DMs again,1
"And if we don't fight, it won't last long",1
"When we talk, I'm never wrong",1
That's what I'm feelin',1
"A little bit of kissin', a little bit of huggin', you know?",1
"You know, a little bit of livin', a little bit of lovin'",1
"Do you feel it, do you feel it, do you feel it too?",1
And do you need it? 'Cause I need it too,1
Do you need it? 'Cause I need it too,1
Are alive at the same time? (Alive at the same time),1
Why can't we act like you and I,1
It's d-d-d-d-decorated in my head,1
'Til I'm thinkin' 'bout your face instead,1
But nobody told mе that safe is so lonely,1
Mimicry is flattering,1
And that distance keeps us safe,1
We can't take back what we nevеr gave,1
Are alive at the same time,1
But I'm just glad you and I,1
If that's what you really want,1
I can be nonchalant,1
"I can't even call you, let alone call you mine",1
Make plans and let 'em fall through,1
Both waitin' for each other to reply,1
Why we ghost each other for a week at a time?,1
"If you need me, all I need is you (Wait)",1
"From industrial, industry hells",1
"I got my space, but what did I pay for you?",1
It's all about what can happen when you lose,1
It's only been a couple days,1
Still I’m fighting and I’ll just keep trying 'till it’s,1
"""And I said like a million vocal things in my head for it""",1
"Once again, this is Waterparks",1
Thank you so much to Otto and Awsten for calling in,1
"Everyone, get stoked, check out Waterparks",1
"Nope, not at all",1
No complaints on this beautiful day,1
"Hey, I'm doin', not doin' too bad",1
"Goin' good, how are you?",1
"Hey, how's it goin'?",1
"And I'm very stoked to have them on the phone right now, what's up?",1
"With ""I'm a Natural Blue""",1
Stay livin' at the tempo,1
'Cause that's just how this shit goes,1
Stay jumpin' at the tempo,1
I ain't gonna let go,1
I'm leavin' when the night goes,1
"(Woo, woo, woo, woo)",1
It's just another night out on Earth,1
Just another night out on Earth,1
'Cause it's a night out on Earth,1
Everything I keep locked behind my back (Let's go),1
It's gettin' hard to keep track of,1
'Cause everyone I know knows another me,1
"If it was up to me, no one I know would know anyone I know",1
"Like triple six but, babe, I'm fuckin' dyin' for you",1
A Capricorn with double horns,1
"Born January 17th, I'm overthinkin' everything",1
"""But like...""",1
*Awsten vocalizing*,1
"""Whatever, fuck it, here""",1
But my paralysis is indefinite,1
"Oh, oh, oh",1
I'll have to jump the gates when I-,1
'Cause they won't let me inside,1
I'll have to jump the gates when I die,1
(Go),1
I don't need those 'cause I won't leave,1
Swallow my shoes and my car keys,1
"If I'm not brainwashed, man, I'm trying to be",1
"It's beating, light speed",1
"Highkey, I swear to God my heart's gonna pop",1
'Cause-,1
You’ll be wrapped around my fingertips,1
And my eyes are frozen for you,1
"Highkey, when we fuck",1
'Cause I am all for you,1
I was the one who kept myself standing tall,1
You were the light at the end of the hall,1
I followed bright signals sent my way,1
'Cause I’m steady day by day,1
So now I’m swimming in slow seconds with you,1
"If you're toxic, I'll wear a hazmat",1
"""Love you"" in all caps, you know that",1
"Yeah, I might be, 'cause I",1
They say I'm brainwashed,1
By your lightning,1
I feel like I'm struck,1
Did therapy four times this week from my bike,1
I gotta hide everybody that I like,1
Am I gonna go to Hell in my sleep or will God forgive me?,1
I've been fucked so much that I no longer wait,1
"Desensitized, the love I get is virtual",1
Is it just me or is it everyone?,1
Am I missin' out? Am I havin' fun?,1
That I let you down?,1
Or will it kill me on the evenin',1
Can it be easy now?,1
'Cause I loved you or I tried to,1
But we ran it all down,1
Used to need you and feel you,1
"So, yeah, I loved you or I tried to",1
Just in case,1
I sabotage and break my own heart,1
"I got my space, but what'd I pay?",1
"The last one for a while, can't get worse (Uh-huh)",1
The lonely one I let myself create,1
I hope you never rain on my charade,1
And I'm the B-side throwaway,1
You're the song that I loved but then overplayed,1
You're the eyes I gave up tryin' to captivate,1
'Cause you're the holiday I celebrate too late,1
"No, no, no",1
We can try to get us right,1
"Maybe in another life (In ano—, in another life, ooh)",1
"It's the darkest afterglow, mm",1
There's nothin' left to let go,1
Still I’m fighting still I’m fighting for you,1
"Now Jesus hates my guts, it's gettin' personal (Yeah)",1
Now if I ever feel jealous (What?),1
I kissed a couple people in a week,1
"Life gave me lemons, now I bleed lemonade (Yeah, yeah, yeah)",1
"It's a hell of a time, was I loved or was I right?",1
Now I just wanna fall asleep in my own,1
'Cause life got kinda hectic on the day I got my necklace,1
I could fall asleep in my old bed,1
I could drive my Lexus overnight back home to Texas,1
"(What I'm saying, the bottom line is)",1
(Fuck),1
"The last one for a while, can't get worse",1
"The glove don't fit, but I wear it anyway, yeah, yeah (Let's go, yeah)",1
Everywhere I walk's a toxic parade (Let's go),1
Gets so fuckin' hot under all this shade,1
Now I wear my red flags like a cape,1
"I'm comin' in first, so pour the Gatorade",1
I just turn it into lyrics and I fuckin' sell it,1
Got superhuman strength when I'm fuckin' up your day,1
"See, now I wear my red flags like a cape",1
And I'm gonna make sure you get it through your head before you go (Asshole),1
But now it's fuck you and everyone you know,1
"Like, I've known you forever, watched your little band grow""",1
"""Oh, come on man, we're bros",1
Will I make a post shoutin' out your lemonadе stand? Nah,1
"Tеll me what you want about your brand, band",1
"Some version, I guess (Dude, oh my god, just, just fuckin')",1
"So I get hit by Houston friends like, ""Do you remember me?""",1
I turn pain into rent and sing along,1
And now when I get depressed and make songs,1
And my heart’s still broke,1
"Wait, what am I sayin'? I feel insane",1
He was fighting completely for survival,1
That keep me company when all I want is sleep,1
Check my watch,1
I don't know,1
Deprеssed or count blessings,1
Soundtrack to forgetting,1
And a sun that's setting,1
I need a place to breathе,1
Driving where no one can catch me,1
With a brand new set of car keys,1
Or cut my neck,1
So cut the check,1
I only see my friends on stage,1
And fuck the rest,1
Endorse the truth,1
Try to drown it out,1
My 3D goggles sounds,1
And fucking freaking out,1
The world is free for now,1
"I guess at least my work is working, right?",1
Is where you might be,1
"And really, all I think about",1
It's all I want and all I need,1
Another thousand times to get it right,1
I guess I've got the time to lose my mind,1
And to unlearn my hurt,1
I want what you deserve,1
I want the softest words,1
I want the fireworks,1
"1, 2, Testing",1
Tick Tock,1
I hope we last long,1
My self-esteem could use some obsession,1
And while I'm alone (Um),1
Everyone whose eyes look up to me,1
"Everywhere I go, I'm poisoning (Yeah)",1
"I'm a ray of sunshine, look at me",1
"Maybe if I look real close, I'll see you in the-",1
I got a little taller since the first show,1
"A broken escalator's still stairs, though",1
"I don't even care, though",1
Fuck it,1
"(Not Zayn though, Harry though, what's up)",1
Chicka-chicka-from at least One Di-One Direction,1
Some ups in my direction,1
Maybe I could use a couple yes-men,1
4001,1
Woah (Fuck it),1
But what's a meltdown between friends?,1
I don't wanna say too much,1
Why am I lying when I say I feel content?,1
And I grew up and became who I want to be,1
If I got everything I want on album 3,1
(What happens next?) I guess we’ll never,1
Right now,1
But knowing that won't make letting you down hurt less,1
Knowing that shit's the first step,1
Because I've wronged a lot,1
Enough time to right my wrongs,1
I hope you'll be here when it's done,1
They'll forget my albums,1
Please make me sane for you,1
"See, no one ever leaves when they're company",1
'Cause you said it:,1
(She’s got me in my own head now,1
Filling it up with aspirations),1
"It's like that, that, that, that",1
And don't forget yourself,1
So I'll say fuck the past,1
But I'm bad at that,1
"Yeah, I'm reflecting back",1
I'm the last one left on my good side,1
I got home last night on a red-eye,1
"The world revolves around me, sleeping soundly",1
"There's my audience, there's my arrogance",1
That was a joke,1
"Singing, ""Is it me you're looking for?""",1
"I did great, you should've been there",1
I spent today winning arguments against no one in my head,1
Come out of your human self,1
"The only way is to, like",1
"To, like, really participate in ""juking"" the system",1
"The only way to, likе-",1
Is all built off of a gladiator mentality,1
"It's, like, crazy because thе whole fucking thing",1
"It's literally fucking gladiators, they love to see-",1
-Because they just wanna see you and that fucking other guy fight,1
"That's why, that's why the media is like-",1
And his whole survival completely relied upon a stadium full of people,1
Now I'm walking through my heart shaped door,1
Pink velvet on my bedroom floor,1
"“Who?”, “What?”, “When?”, and “Why?” all drive me crazy",1
"""You're all we want and more""",1
To love you safely,1
"A touch I'm failing to feel, or feel enough",1
Cherry Red's your touch,1
When no one’s watching,1
Like the way you move,1
Hope you'll be here when it's done,1
"They'll forget my albums, I",1
Without me hating you,1
Without them fading,1
To want the things I want,1
It's nice to daydream a-about a daydream,1
Violins like this make me feel crazy,1
Heard voices from my closet door,1
You're all I want and more,1
"Singing, ""What the fuck'd I do it for?""",1
Now I'm walking through my star-shaped morgue,1
Cause you said it:,1
It's like that that that that,1
So listen to me,1
I see his fucking face but he's not me,1
"Yeah, I see the posts and I see the tweets",1
Where I'm stacking up my reality,1
I'm projecting big through a tiny screen,1
"Yeah, I'm fucking up, I'm recording it",1
I spent today insubordinate,1
But you said it:,1
I could fill a fucking university with all the things,1
Cause demons drive their limo,1
What if I pray? Hopin' you'll stay into the daylight,1
Like they're motherfucking Postmates and late,1
Gets real super dark,1
Around the edge of my heart (Go),1
(Never reap what you sow),1
It gets real super dark,1
(Where the fuck are you going?),1
Bite tongue till there's blood in my mouth (Bleh),1
"Da-da-da, da-da, da-da (One more fuckin' time)",1
"Da-da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da (Woo)",1
"I kill time playin' tennis with your favorite band, we're singin'",1
"Therapy's not working, I don't understand so",1
"But when they try and tell me, volume's muted like they're sound asleep",1
"I'm Miss Congeniality, everybody's proud of me",1
"(Otto, get in the car, get back in the car)",1
"(Otto, where are you going?)",1
So now I’ve said that this has gone too far,1
Bite tongue 'til there's blood in my mouth (Bleh),1
"Da-da-da, da-da, da-da",1
"Da-da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da",1
"But, baby, it's gettin' too loud",1
"'Cause if I could time it right, shit could go Platinum",1
"But, man, I can't die 'til I finish the album",1
"My fans are the best, they'd love me more dead",1
Here are a few of the notes,1
"I'm alienated, way overrated",1
I'm dyin' to give you a show,1
I'm out of my cage and I'm on the stage,1
"I'll call you, beep you later if Otto doesn't serial kill me (Otto, I'm sorry, stop)",1
"(Otto, don't be mad at this)",1
"(Woo, yeah! Otto! Otto!)",1
"(Oh, man, you don't look so good)",1
"3 AM, she walked in, took a hit",1
"Don't take it away, I wanna play, where did the time fly?",1
"A language that I'm not familiar, oh",1
Shocked at the words comin' from my tongue,1
"What's up? Hello, I'm tryna meet ya",1
"She walked away, I didn't get her name",1
It feels like I’ve been here,1
"""I know your dying wish is to be baptized in my spit""",1
"She rolled her eyes, and then she said",1
"I said that you can call me, beep me if you want my skin",1
"And said ''Well, now you're gonna die too''",1
She kinda smiled and she blew it in my face,1
"I said, ''That shit is gonna kill you'' (kill you)",1
Too many times before,1
"11 PM, she walked in with her friends",1
I just want you to bе my next mistake that I'm gonna make (Oh),1
So even though I stopped this once not so long ago,1
"She wore a sweatеr, it was funeral grey",1
I never made my mistakes; you’ll never reap what you sow,1
I can't explain the look on her face (Woo),1
"She said, ""Don't disagree with me""",1
"And I said, ""That's not a color, it's a shade""",1
She pointed at her waist,1
"And I said, ""What's your favorite color?""",1
"'Cause I know you'll make my head spin, yeah",1
So call me a Lyft or a black hearse,1
And now I'm trippin' off the deep end (Deep end),1
So leave some tears after the **** if you're feelin' silly,1
'Cause I just drove through AP on my brand-new jet ski,1
"Oh, you mean Benji? He's fuckin' busy",1
"Take a second, gonna breathe",1
Dudes with beards online like to say shit,1
"I am not about the ""he said, she said"" bullshit",1
I'm Geoff and I'm Otto nose-ringing it,1
The way I'm Michael Scott-o Sebringing it,1
It's really fucking crippling,1
That made me think I'm not enough,1
And every single magazine,1
Fuck everyone and everything,1
Okay,1
We're gonna do this one more time,1
"Otto, Geoff, you guys are doing great",1
You and me,1
We really did it,1
"But I was just like them, just hating",1
"Ohhh, yeah, we did it this time",1
But we'll get there when we get there when we get there when we get there when we-,1
And everything I know is gonna kill me in the end,1
"If I'm the guy from Castaway, that makes you Wilson, hate to say",1
I never had it anyway,1
Like how if everything could go away,1
"Shit never showed up, what's up? That's fucked",1
Put down a hundred bucks,1
"Where the fuck is my flying truck, bitch?",1
"Let me talk to Elon Musk, man",1
"Bill Gates, hey",1
"God damn, hot damn",1
Tweeting middle fingers up from their day shift,1
"I gave up everything, something to nothing",1
Let me speak to your manager,1
Too far (yeah!),1
"I'm saying picture that but, like, right before things go dark",1
(That's the law of attract—),1
"Yeah, it just hurts 'cause I want it",1
But this shit hits like a comet and it just hurts 'cause I want it,1
"I don't wanna be toxic, I just wanna be honest",1
"You can't hide my face but save me for a rainy day, it don't go two ways (No)",1
Bet you wouldn't ask me to do that by this time next year,1
"I'll go away, but LA's such a fuckin' weird place (One, two, three, four)",1
I signed somebody's NDA,1
But you're just a starfucker,1
Maybe I'm a soul-sucker,1
Too far,1
Runnin' back to you at the speed of sound,1
"This song is the recipe, curses, my blessings",1
I'm climbin' up to your window now,1
"I'll always be around, in fact",1
Jesus Christ won't text me back,1
"And crash out where I sleep, yeah",1
So I can drive you fuckin' crazy,1
And into a limousine,1
I'm gonna move out of my loft,1
"(Like a big breath, close your eyes and shit)",1
"(Yo, imagine an album starting with this)",1
But then there's nothing left of me,1
"Missing on holidays, give people more",1
"I haven't seen family, hoping they're proud of me",1
I think people like me better when I'm hurt inside,1
Miss Unfaithful hit the backboard breaking bed springs,1
But it's really how I'm feeling here,1
And what I need is trying to,1
Nothing here is as appealing,1
As my heart wants to believe,1
It is and that's the other reason,1
Why I can't stop pushing deeper,1
"Let's talk about shows and ghosts and shows and clothes designs and shows and shows... (Okay, I think you might be right)",1
"Well, that's fine too because I'm fucking sick of talking about it",1
"""Nobody wants to hear you cry about your breakup, so drop it.""",1
And I've got a crystal ball,1
'Cause y'all are stuck in the past,1
About cut vocals and pop,1
I can't wait for the complaints,1
Multiple times,1
We didn't have approval before label signs,1
I wanna live life with heavy '11 vibes,1
And I'd stop this reeling,1
I'd cut them out completely,1
To burn out these feelings,1
If I could find my something,1
And the wondering,1
I'm tired of the waiting,1
Have you found someone new?,1
Killing off the 'something to do's,1
Around for nothing,1
I've been waiting,1
And bid the quiet adieu,1
I'll hide the things that pain me,1
Down the rabbit hole to see the,1
So break me cause I've got the feeling,1
I treat walking the plank,1
Like I'm jumping off a diving board,1
The best time for truth is soon,1
You stopped me in my tracks,1
And write you songs like this today,1
When you're out I miss you badly,1
But better ways are gems today so,1
I can see a crumbling scene of mockingbirds,1
Breaking their teeth eating golden words,1
The last thing kids need is you,1
Keep me 'round to see what I'd endure,1
And kick my boxes from the left,1
And if I left I'd hope you'd stop me,1
Because you know I'd miss you bad,1
If you died I'd hope you'd haunt me,1
Now of course it's too late,1
Listening to The Latest Plague,1
But at least I 'fessed up,1
And I know I messed up,1
Which I know is messed up,1
I couldn't tell her I adored her,1
Like even when I did,1
For me to be straightforward,1
It's harder than it should be,1
And crack my brain out of it's cage,1
I'm afraid to dive headfirst,1
Without a bitter aftertaste,1
I can't just give a love song,1
I breathe nostalgia until I'm bored,1
Other side and what I need,1
There will come a day when I will make things different,1
It's one of the things that I just can't help these days,1
Throw down everything and make it futuristic,1
For days and days and days,1
You drop your guy and take me on,1
But your talk is so inviting,1
I'm becoming what I've hated,1
You keep your guy in hiding,1
There's gotta be a reason,1
But behind the scenes with her I'm playing 21 Questions,1
"I've got a loud mouth, I'm pale with a ghost obsession",1
Or a person I could blame,1
I wish there was a situation to be mad at,1
'Cause I don't need anything the way that I need you,1
To take a breath and let these people stay floor bound,1
Sometimes when I'm with you I remember to slow down,1
But by then it's all too late and I forget what I know,1
Until the ice runs up my hands and then I'm froze,1
Sometimes when I'm writing I forget that I'm cold,1
"And if that goes well, maybe a feature too",1
Maybe if we're lucky we'll get a review,1
While absolutepunk's sucking off beard-punk songs,1
I wanna be a sellout just to piss y'all off,1
"Or else dudes won't like me 'cause ""it's just not their thing"" (Fuck you)",1
I still think it's dumb I need to strain when I sing,1
I just shot my horizons out much farther,1
They say I went soft while going harder,1
When nobody cared?,1
Before we hit the high gear,1
Where were you last year,1
But I'm afraid I'd go on and on,1
That'd string into a phrase,1
I could write a couple words,1
I almost understand,1
I know that not everybody wants to be different,1
"But this is getting ridiculous, oh",1
"I'm not scared, no I'm not",1
And I almost understand,1
Until they start to sound out of tune,1
The same old chords,1
I've been playing,1
A simple sighting will do,1
I'll hide my life savings,1
My sun still sets without you,1
I'll forget you if you need me to,1
Am I in his position now?,1
But the amount between us is wrecking me,1
And had a plan,1
I wanna give you space,1
'Cause you aren't talking to me,1
And it sucks to sleep,1
We built a picture made for frames,1
"I almost understand, oh",1
'Cause we built a picture made for frames,1
That they hit my brain,1
They're falling from my mouth from the time,1
When I've got some words to say,1
Carefully shape sentences,1
I never have to,1
I wish I was aggressive,1
You caught me in a gaze,1
If there ever came a dark day (If there ever came a dark day),1
"You don't need to grip the best (oh-oh, oh-oh)",1
(We're all too cool for fun),1
"You don't like drama, so why you wanna live on top of it?",1
I'm apathetic from this year-long deficit,1
I’m teething (teething),1
I never would've thought that there was any correlation,1
To the people I let down by not remaking Airplane Conversations,1
Down to the t,1
And the people like me,1
"Who should've, could've, would've been the last ones to bleed the future, woah",1
"Your dumb, drunk friends don't care for me and I always told you so",1
"Has taken all, all of me",1
"Mind your head, I lost my mind",1
"('Cause this won't last forever if we both want to die, right?)",1
(Let's both talk in circles like infinity signs),1
"Let me go, let me go down, down, down, down",1
Just push me back to Texas walking bum bum- God damn,1
If why I'm sitting here all goes wrong,1
"You're why I'm sitting here, hating myself for needing someone so bad and feeling dumb dumb dumb dumb",1
I'm taking up grinding teeth,1
"Pardon me, cutting sleep",1
Took all but you,1
"Mind your head, has lost its sight",1
"Where I, I'm",1
Instead of sleeping around like bum bum-,1
You're why I keep my Texas sleep hours on tour,1
Ad-libbing around like bum bum bum bum,1
You're why I'm sitting here making up songs in my room,1
You found me and finders keep,1
I'm sorry I don't hack your phone like he did,1
"And when you need space to breathe, I'll leave it",1
But who needs space from across the country,1
Than the best time of life,1
I think I'll die obsessed,1
And now I’m left dried up and standing here,1
"But hey, for what it's worth",1
You couldn't get much sleep,1
"""Don't think like that""",1
And what's awful is-,1
All I want's The Office,1
Our residence is in this bed,1
If there’s a place right now,1
There’s a way somehow,1
And that’s where I've gotta,1
Where I've gotta be,1
It couldn't get much worse,1
"I'm accustomed to feel like nothing, fuck me",1
You lost yourself in mine,1
To all friends and family: lost or dead,1
We didn't answer nothing,1
We tore our phones to shreds,1
"Your dumb, drunk friends don't care for me, and I always told you so",1
I'm haunted,1
The one I always loved but you were so self-conscious,1
This line's here to make you think of your nose twitch,1
Now out of state plates make me think of something,1
And this line's here to say fuck The 100,1
And all our firsts that we lived in LA,1
This line's here to make you think of Burbank,1
"Pardon me, summer scene",1
But I don't for you (you),1
That crushed us out and took you away,1
I'm seconds from bottles when these seconds feel awful now,1
Let's tangle our legs again,1
To go-oh-oh,1
Can you help me turn this off?,1
Since when's it hurt so bad?,1
I feel like a played-out love song,1
I found your slipper in the cold,1
"Click your heels, I'll take you home",1
Have lost their,1
Glow somehow,1
Everyone wants someone else,1
To wear their skin until it's out,1
"Like, ""Hey thanks, music needs your help",1
My lucky number seven,1
"The way it needs to rot in hell""",1
Originality's a ghost,1
"I ""see"" it when I ""hear"" the most",1
I'm thinking there's a better way,1
When you do me like that can you tell my brain turns off?,1
I feel like a walking love song,1
"Wrong place, good time, consistently",1
You're the beach on Christmas Eve,1
I'd never I'd never I'd never get you off my mind),1
(I'd never I'd never I'd never get you off my mind,1
"I'd never I'd never I'd never get you off my mind (Your everything, everything)",1
I'd never I'd never I'd never leave you out to dry (I'm dying to be),1
I'd chase you to the end of the world,1
I'd chase you to the end,1
The world doesn't need us to leave our heads,1
Let's tie our breath in knots again,1
Nothing's complicated if we pretend,1
Deep through all my idols' graves,1
"I feel trapped in contracts, I'm depressed, tied in gift wrap",1
I'm falling from my couch across these states for you,1
Before I needed help,1
Before we sold out shows,1
I didn't love myself,1
I was stuck at home for some months,1
Now I don't wanna leave,1
"I used to, to crave a getaway",1
A break at home to breathe,1
I go blue when I've had,1
Where I've gotta,1
I swear to God I’m,1
"This isn't all, this isn't all that it's cracked up to be",1
My favorite time to stare's when my eyes are on you,1
Look like they need some help,1
Just watching friends online,1
I haven't loved myself,1
Haven't been home in some months,1
Not hurt that bad,1
To make my still-beating something,1
Blew motivation I had,1
I go blonde when I'm sad,1
"I think the blondes are done, we're all too cool for fun",1
I feel like,1
My ideas,1
"To go-oh-oh, go-oh-oh, go-oh-oh",1
(Now that's convenient.),1
Everybody wants to be friends,1
Are all so conflicting,1
"Tell me, is it all too much?",1
I struggle in most of my songs,1
And now the boys are back,1
'Cause feeling is a rare thing for me,1
Cutting through my hands,1
Even with their words like dog bites,1
I like happy songs that sound nice,1
"And match your weakness with a name, oh",1
Stressing me out,1
Weighing me down,1
I don't want this dead doubt anymore,1
I don't want this black cloud anymore,1
Starts to slip and slur,1
My speech I gripped,1
And gather my words,1
When I feel brave,1
'Bout how deep to get,1
But before I can make up my mind,1
I'm at the bottom of the deep end out of breath,1
And match your weakness with a name,1
"Are not, not on my wish list at all",1
Because birthdays and Christmas,1
And I'm not worth my blisters,1
I'm afraid I messed up,1
And turn out the lights,1
Is when I'm stressed or sad,1
The only time I write,1
It's kind of messed up,1
Now the boys are back,1
Keep me close like your territory,1
Just to keep me on my toes,1
Just double dare me,1
Because we're out of work,1
Shut down the gold rush in my head,1
"Hey, can you come-a come out and play",1
"Hey, tell me that you want me to stay",1
Keep me close like I was chosen,1
I'm gonna hunt you down,1
Cause I'm a handful,1
I'm gonna freak you out,1
But it's all substantial,1
So bring me bad news,1
It's not like you're married but I still got carried away,1
And I promise now that I'll stay,1
But only when you miss the rain like I miss you,1
Anything you have to,1
I'll be your black cloud by June,1
I'll be your new favorite tune,1
Until we melt and go back to your hotel room,1
Reciting recycled news,1
Let's trash our whole afternoon,1
Let's match our faces and be equally in love,1
Jealous and hypnotized,1
At least I'll match your eyes,1
Let's get together and be green like my insides,1
"You're yellow, I'm natural blue",1
I'm color-coding my moods,1
"Hey, can you come-a come out and play?",1
(That’s all too much),1
And maybe like I’m all too much,1
These feelings that I'm feeling,1
"Like I’m saturated, cold and calm",1
If the grass was green enough but dull in my life,1
I feel like I expired in Houston last year,1
Watching my friends finish college,1
It tastes like no one will ever love us the way we do,1
And bitter doesn't taste so bad,1
But I don't wanna be like that,1
The anything slash everything that I should be,1
And I can't see:,1
Can someone clean them up because my vision’s getting foggy,1
If my eyes are the windows to where my soul should be,1
One of my favorite few,1
"You're one of my favorite, can't even take it",1
"I, one of my favourite",1
I'll hold them off until they don't let me,1
As I watch plan b and c escape,1
It seems like a crash landing will always just come in handy,1
It's just that it's not fun when I find out you're playing for the other team,1
"I'm sorry about that, you know I'm sorry about me",1
While I'm all alone out here,1
"'Cause I think I've seen enough of you today, today, today",1
"'Cause I think I've seen enough of you today, today, today, today",1
My hours live in double time,1
A headache lives between my eyes,1
I hold it hostage to a fault,1
I swear it's all just momentary,1
So bear with me while I lose my cool,1
So frustrated on the daily,1
Would I even make a move or even try to give myself a chance to switch up sides?,1
I'm settling and wrestling,1
But I'm over these,1
"It was easy enough, but, but",1
My influx of emotion's got me feeling in slow motion,1
And it's all too much,1
I built these walls around me,1
From the hours I lost in traffic,1
I miss the time when I thought I had it,1
Ohhh,1
(Laugh),1
I'm afraid of heights,1
But I'm done with this place,1
So I want to go up,1
'Til we run out of space,1
It was all too much,1
I pull my head down from its dark cloud,1
'Cause I don't wanna feel so mad,1
"I was bitter, but I'm fine now",1
(I don't wanna be like that),1
"Tell me, will we fall off? (Regressing slowly, falling from heights to crawl)",1
"Tell me, are we far gone? (Are we all wrong? Are we falling off?)",1
"Tell me, are we all wrong? (I can't just wait here, for the impending fall)",1
All wrong (Are we all wrong? Are we falling off?),1
"'Cause no one will be here, be here forever",1
I hope you watch me through the letdown,1
"'Cause no one stays in first class, not forever",1
Hold your applause until the letdown,1
To feel like no one will ever love us the way that I do,1
I'd never let it get that bad,1
I'm living proof of compromise,1
"""Be back in 10""",1
But no return,1
I'm sick of being in Houston,1
I'm just waiting on your green light,1
You know I'd make the time,1
Tell me all my favorite things you've said before,1
"With you on the other end, filling up my tired head",1
I really wouldn't mind a 20 hour drive,1
"Yeah, everything slows down, down, down, down",1
I don't hear from my friends anymore,1
"Yeah, everything slows down by 24",1
"I don't wanna think about it, because",1
That climb to the back of my head tying my veins in knots,1
So I can't numb my feelings to avoid my thoughts,1
Which is the last thing that I want since I don't drink,1
Daylight savings gives me time to think,1
But I'm afraid I'd go off for,1
Days and days and days and days,1
"Crave, crave, crave, crave",1
"Smooth talk, a getaway from the–",1
"I don't wanna think I've got it, because",1
"""Stay the same.""",1
But I'll just take another sip until my eyes drip,1
I wanna pour my feelings down the drain,1
I wish I was as brave as my last name suggests,1
If I could I'd trade my heart for a second brain,1
The honest pieces,1
We're culture vultures picking from,1
Conveniently spiritual,1
Like the movies,1
"Yeah, I'll be at your porch by this time tomorrow",1
"'Cause I'm almost not fine, but I'd never let you know",1
That'd fall into a phrase,1
I want you to need me like I need you,1
I ripped into you with my Black Light,1
I've still got my bite,1
I've still got my bark,1
We're mad all the time,1
My friends and I are mad,1
I'm sick of handshakes with fake ass band guys,1
I never liked it anyway,1
And you can devastate my personal space,1
"Yeah, let's call it a date",1
But I was thinking we could get away sometime,1
It's sad but it's true: no one's waiting for you,1
I need you to see me when I'm see-through,1
But I've found her,1
I could write a couple lines,1
Distance makes the heart grow fonder,1
'Cause I'll be out of Texas by this time tomorrow,1
"Let's meet in Anaheim, I'm sick of waiting for the ""right time""",1
Tell me something new you haven't told before,1
"With you on the other side, lifting up my tired eyes",1
I really wouldn't mind my fear of taking flights,1
For the past couple weeks I've felt kind of great,1
But this kind of great don't come without its share of grey,1
I've been chewing off bites from my day to day,1
But by night I'm left with nothing but a sour taste,1
I'd give all kinds of something,1
To have a plan,1
With filtered mood swings,1
They're selling you a touched up name,1
To lust for what you're missing,1
Don't believe me? Ask Geoff,1
And everything's a blur to me,1
I'm so out of touch with everyone,1
I know that there's no dealing with the way I'm feeling,1
That wants nothing to do with me,1
I fall in love with everything,1
So keep your eyes off of me,1
You won't like what you see,1
'Cause everything is on the down low for now,1
But I live at home,1
Because I'm living my dreams,1
"But is ""alright"" enough?",1
And I'm doing alright,1
'Cause I work myself to death,1
"Don't need the air between our lips, no",1
"Maybe I'm seconds late, always late",1
Maybe I missed the frame,1
But I'm just not in the picture,1
You've painted your future,1
In the quicksand,1
I think the answer,1
Is in the open,1
My common myth's confidence,1
And I kill what I build,1
And exhausting common sense,1
I'm proof of consequences,1
I'm sick of everything I've been around enough to get used to,1
"Find you, keep you",1
Hide and seek through,1
It's basically tradition,1
I won't slow my pace until you walk away,1
Buying bracelets and then channeling,1
"We're justice warriors when we're bored, you see?",1
"Oh wait, they're indie",1
I wear my game face,1
In your headspace,1
And selling you a filtered frame,1
Counting back down from showtime,1
The highlights from these low-lives,1
We're online just in time to see:,1
We're spiritual when we wanna be,1
With you (But can you really get lost in heaven?),1
Oh woah oh oh oh (Can you really get lost in heaven?),1
Where it's storming,1
"A hundred ""should've walked away""s",1
At least most days,1
Because I want you now,1
And lately where I waste my time,1
That's where I keep you,1
When I climb into my mind,1
I kind of see you,1
And I've been thinking,1
We lost a few years,1
Because I want it all,1
Everything to fly out and see you,1
I'm a double dare away from dropping,1
"To find you, keep you",1
Let's give up fighting back,1
Because we're lucky people,1
"My Drake problems, my fake problems",1
"Now all that's left here are my lonely words, dear",1
Of things I'd like to forget,1
Behind my forehead's an assortment,1
I miss seeing the red on your face when I made you blush,1
When are you gonna sing for me?,1
So their meaning starts to soften,1
But I still get death threats often,1
I'm not even an icon,1
But what the fuck have I done?,1
Cutting people off because I don't trust exciting,1
Pushing away these girls that maybe really like me,1
My hobbies include,1
"And if we sit and count it up, it's really not a lot",1
"No one cares what I want, just what I've got",1
"""Can you text and can you follow back 'cause it's my birthday?""",1
"""Is that your real first name?""",1
"I'm sick of all this, ""How'd you get your band name?""",1
I'm sleeping off without your,1
"'Cause this is what you've done, you've done to me, mmh, oh",1
Now all the girls in Los Angeles look like you from a distance,1
I'm wishing I was home again,1
Instead of waking me up at 4 a.m.,1
"God, what does that say about me?",1
Regressing back to high school,1
I'm rolling in the cycle,1
"Wait, what am I doing to me?",1
"No, we don't need a two-way",1
"So, fly out on a Tuesday",1
I wear a smile that's about a mile wide,1
I'd like to sport it,1
"It's my fault I miss my friends, I'm lonely every day",1
I play along,1
You know you could've been a classic,1
Maybe stop hitting my cell,1
And keep yourself far away,1
"Yeah, keep that shit to yourself",1
So get your coke off my bus,1
Tell me I look handsome,1
Just keep your fucking hands up,1
My death will be the fandom,1
Pray to be important,1
God's favorite fucking boy band,1
To chase us down,1
"I love it all, love it all",1
"In my paradise, 'dise, 'dise, d'-d'-d'",1
'Cause they all stayed in Texas when I moved away,1
And tear us inside out,1
I saved my own life,1
I'm forgetting how to hate myself,1
Think I'd rather stay blind,1
Now I'm turning off my headlights,1
Your knight in shining plastic,1
I'm scared my songs will turn to static,1
Do we even do bad shit? (In my paradise),1
Let's go do some bad shit (What the fuck are you talking about?),1
So I'll call Jawn and Zakk and Travis,1
Scared they're falling off and take it out on me,1
I'm learning bands I loved don't want the best for me,1
I'll paint you pretty with my syntax,1
But I sent it off in gift wrap,1
I play alone,1
I never thought I'd let myself give what you took,1
Let's try words (Let's try words),1
Tour brings that special pain,1
Every single day,1
Writing you songs and singing them all like,1
You had your own Pete Wentz and Patrick combined,1
And we're all friends,1
And my name's Awsten,1
And my name's Geoff,1
My name's Otto,1
And I'm reaping all the benefits,1
He's losing his mind,1
I’ve gotta let you know,1
('Cause I think that I love you so),1
(You could be my only one),1
(That I think that I love you so),1
(I've gotta let you know),1
"Where you go, I'll follow",1
All these aisles feel like miles,1
And I'm thinking that I lost it,1
"Now I lost my self-control, I can't stop thinking",1
I'm living on a target and you shot it with an arrow,1
With pictures of our faces 'til we share a name,1
"I talk a lot, but we could fill your frames",1
Less slow verbs (Less slow verbs),1
Of how much this hurts (How much this hurts),1
'Cause I think that I love you so,1
And I'd never want to complicate your heart,1
(But they both have an ugly side),1
We have the biggest sparkling eyes,1
Fall into exposure,1
You had a taste of the life,1
And sleep it off without your kiss,1
'Cause all the girls in Los Angeles look like you from a distance,1
'Cause I'll keep hopping on these planes 'til we're sharing last names and a softer scene,1
It's like God fell asleep in the middle of the day He built my self-esteem,1
"There's a million pairs here, string along my soul, dear, 'til my breath feels useless",1
"I never thought I'd let myself wear the weak look, but I guess if the shoe fits",1
We are expected,1
But only in the best way,1
And that's where you left me to die,1
Up in the back of your mind,1
And my sanity laced itself,1
But you grew complacent,1
And said to work with it,1
We are supposed to,1
You gave me hell on Earth,1
My anxiety was turbulent and permanent,1
And I never fucking answer,1
Even though I blocked your number,1
How about the messages that you still send?,1
"Let's see, where to start?",1
"Well, I know you are",1
You must be out of your mind,1
"He texted back fast, and he made you laugh, yeah, yeah",1
You had your own Awsten Knight (Hi),1
To live a small time,1
A year: expired,1
But now you'll never have shit,1
I love it all (Love it all),1
And you'll never have to sleep alone,1
I’m just waiting for my chance to put a,1
Because I,1
All night,1
Play a little game called hide and sleep,1
"Me, myself, and I",1
Everything is alright,1
Climb into my bad night,1
Welcome to the intro,1
I hide under my pillow,1
My demons drive a limo,1
These are your Greatest Hits,1
(Take this time you have),1
(The world is yours if you want it),1
(Nothing will ever be the same),1
'Cause if revenge is for the weak,1
"My sheets, my sheets, my—",1
"In the dark between my sheets (Oh, Oh)",1
"In the dark between my sheets, my sheets (Oh, oh)",1
"Had to meet you, now I'm watching past me in the rearview",1
2015 was cold and I was see-through,1
"I was broke but sold half of my records, gave the money to an airline",1
It's where I flew to see you for the first time,1
(I chose the worst place),1
"I flew to California, I",1
(So I tried to get away),1
Sober makes the months go slower,1
Well I guess I’m getting somewhat stronger,1
There are still a few things I can’t swallow,1
See shadows on my walls,1
Because I’ve changed and now I’m here,1
Please forgive me if you missed me,1
I don't want another timeline,1
I just cried into a shirt I could never afford last year,1
But I'mma knock 'em down down down,1
(Everything gets fuzzy when you come around),1
"So, kill another demon",1
Say a little prayer for you,1
I'm really not a bad guy,1
When I hear your sound,1
That everything gets fuzzy,1
I think that you should know,1
I hear them getting closer,1
And we can't leave you here,1
"Me, myself, and I talked",1
I'm running and I can't stay here,1
But if anybody's there,1
Now I've gotta go,1
I really had a good time,1
Glowing in the dark,1
I'll be waiting,1
Kill another demon,1
"Say a little prayеr for you, yeah",1
I'm rеally not a bad guy,1
I got a little frostbite,1
I'm cold like the first time,1
I Jet when it's midnight,1
"Black cat, like a bad sign",1
I’m not sure who is listening,1
But I’ll take care of those tomorrow,1
Now I don't see my face the same,1
 Lyrics,1
And you left the picture frames,1
"Anxiety is real, depression's very heavy",1
I know it's hard but is all love 'tough love'?,1
Dealing with this shit sober's got me fucked up,1
"Dream boy, dream boy, dream boy, dream boy, dream",1
"Dream boy, dream boy",1
"I never promised you your dream boy, dream, dream boy",1
And lost them all on you,1
I had 101 wishes,1
"Yeah, here, I got you a preview",1
I tried to make life a movie,1
You're gonna be just like your mother,1
"Headache, you're dead weight",1
You're not worth another,1
You're not worth my color,1
(I never promised you your dream boy),1
We are the young blood,1
The “any-time” assumption,1
The overstayed,1
With a jaded name,1
We are the truce,1
Waiting for bad news,1
Dying in the mood light,1
Turning on your high beams,1
Worth all of the long nights,1
You were supposed to be the first sigh,1
I used to need your voice and now I need to sleep alone,1
"I used to want to save you, now I don't",1
"I wear them both inside my hoodie, wear them out to get me",1
You wanna get drunk so you can't remember nothing,1
"It was me or whiskey, now you're pissed I wasn't bluffing",1
Didn't wanna listen but you proved them right,1
But then you ran away,1
You moved in behind my eyes and built yourself a shrine,1
I'd never seen a face with your type of shine,1
"Picture of me, put a picture of me in the",1
Dream scenes of my ideal future,1
Pretty cool,1
'Cause I think you're the worst of them all,1
"Think you're the worst of them all, oh-oh-oh",1
"Think you're the worst of them all, yeah",1
'Cause I think you're the worst of them all (All),1
"All, all, all, mm-mm",1
"I watched you blow it, fuck it",1
"I'm a poet and you know it, I'm a business, steady growing",1
"Fuck it, took a couple shots, don't you dare fucking miss me",1
"I'd buy you anything on solid ground, yeah",1
You had both in one but fucked around,1
"Oh, what's that? (What?)",1
You want a boss or a fucking white boy with a six pack?,1
Nights never been so loud without your voice's sound,1
Am I dealing with a break up or a breakdown?,1
But I think it's so weird to actually do that,1
It's 20-30 and there's no time for that,1
"It's like, everybody tells you gotta love yourself",1
(I’m just waiting,1
But all that means is a new beginning),1
It's things like this that make me,1
I'm interested but distant to a fault,1
Let's talk about your parents and your future dreams,1
I'd like to know your middle name,1
Maybe if I kill myself you'll know I'm sincere,1
And if I see you in person,1
"And John-shit Will, yeah, y'all made it",1
It's Richard and Clayton,1
"-Nah fuck it, here we go:",1
I'll keep them nameless,1
And to the rest,1
You'll catch some swings and no misses,1
Try to come around again,1
That tried to move on my missus (Cam),1
To a certain married mister,1
But I've just got a couple more things to say really quick,1
It's become more than a hassle,1
We're freaked out and fragile,1
"But we don't know you, you don't know we",1
But now people use my friends to try to get to me (Fuck you),1
I'm getting texts from idols I've looked up to since 15,1
Can't you see I've got my hands full?,1
"So, excuse my tantrum",1
Second guess the feel,1
Call it everything at once ‘cause,1
This is days on days,1
But something’s changed,1
‘Cause nothing good can stay the same,1
Every single time you throw your white flag down and surrender,1
"Like ""fuck it, who cares?""",1
Drop from 'parks,1
Burn the rest of two dares,1
I'm taking teeth,1
"Trust, you've earned this",1
"Thank you for coming by, today was a really good day",1
"When you check on your texts, or not?",1
And there's nothing wrong with being happy,1
Or if it’s just me and everything's bad and it’s all falling down to finally come true,1
Then they were right about you,1
Say it like you should,1
Because a call to arms,1
Is a calling card,1
"I feel dead and a half, but you're making me laugh",1
"I'm selling out to the dream, I'll be cool on my own",1
Last week showed me I'm scared to be all alone,1
You hold me by the heart and you wear my soul,1
I thought I told you it's that gloom boy season?,1
"Don't you, don't you know it's that gloom boy season?",1
Do your eyes miss my name,1
I just want to be invisible with you,1
Your mess in my chest has me stressed and depressed,1
Your silent sting concretely left my face twisted,1
"Now I'm squinting at life through my sad, sour vision",1
Maybe I can sleep through my mood 'til June,1
I'll please you until you're sick of me in full,1
After chasing you through my dreams in bloom,1
You're the morning I can't wait to wake to,1
And I’m calling soon,1
Hoping I can get through to you,1
My pity party's not the same without you,1
Just squeeze me until my skin turns to dark blue,1
I drift in and out of time zones with you,1
I'll shave my blue hair,1
If I wasn't thin and white with blue hair would I be here?,1
"It's like that, it's like that",1
"Let's put away our black clothes and start cutting up our voices. That's what's cool now, right?",1
But I'll let go if you do too,1
When we carry 'round our worried flurried minds,1
'Cause I know it's hard to let yourself be fine,1
I used to laugh at on my own,1
You've got me writing sappy songs,1
"You've got my time, you are my plans",1
My hourglass is in your hands,1
I hope I get through,1
Through to you,1
I couldn’t keep up,1
With watering myself down,1
And so all that grew,1
Was the high tide until I drowned,1
From the world,1
Full of love I can't control,1
I'll be your optimistic black hole,1
The oxygen had all run out,1
I wanna burn bright 'til we're not,1
Light us up until we pop,1
But I'm nervous at my central for you),1
(I'm sweating out potential,1
Except the shots I take and phone calls from you),1
(There's nothing left to miss,1
So I'm feeling what I feel for you),1
(There's nothing in my system,1
"Hey, for what it's worth)",1
(I couldn't get much sleep,1
My common sense is powerless,1
And I'm convinced that you,1
"Have caught me, luck is just the half of it",1
'Cause every single time you throw your white flag down and surrender,1
Fuck these fuckboy bands that can't think for themselves,1
(Just know I think you're rare),1
And I hope it's nicer where you are,1
And now my stomach's cold,1
I’ve clocked 300 ways,1
I think it's weird I need your love,1
I’ve got to say,1
"Your Cali gaze has stuck me spinning, dripping sweetness hidden in my face",1
Let's make some plans for time to waste,1
Just know I think you're-),1
(Just know I think you're rare,1
But this is something I can’t lose,1
We are the new wave crashing the same day,1
The better half of me that I couldn't quit,1
(We are the new wave crashing the same day),1
We are the new wave crashing the same,1
"(We are the new wave, we are the new wave)",1
Until it's all washed up,1
Because we'll be crashing soon,1
But before we do,1
"When I'm too phased, but that's not here or there so I'll give you the phrase that pays",1
I save my metaphors for rainy days,1
"But you're my yellow, lovely",1
You've got me more than clumsy,1
More than monthly for you,1
'Cause now I'm flying 'cross the country,1
Living in the dark makes our light seem cold,1
"I distract myself awake, but in my dreams you're playing our song",1
"I'll tell my friends we made amends, tying up loose ends, they're not sold",1
"But if you want it you can have it, you can have me in full",1
But now I go through the pictures I keep stuck in my phone,1
I used to need the words you wrote,1
"Worn like a mood ring past my neck, oh (oh)",1
I'll change the colors on my head,1
(You're hard to love),1
Because people only like the boys in bands,1
Who are plagued with troubled thoughts,1
"So give me, give me problems",1
Cut me out for this job,1
"We both know you'd never stop until we both fell dead, it's like",1
"My blue and green, they turned to red, oh",1
Frustrate me backwards into bed,1
"Yeah, if it's up to me",1
You'll never be alone with me,1
I'm your favorite holiday,1
Your beloved getaway,1
Custom-made,1
"Heart destroyed, I'm your boy",1
Overjoyed‚ never leave your,1
"Build-A-Boy, pick my pieces",1
Because I was born to be your favorite,1
I'm modern and I'm dated,1
Make me complicated,1
'Cause I was born to be your favorite,1
Saturated and inflated,1
Build your expectations,1
Living in your subconscious‚ oh,1
It's like cutting up the sentiment we were friends,1
"But now I'm vexed and pissed and confident, it's like",1
"It's too easy to hate you, you're hard to love",1
Now I'm lonely,1
Because I can't handle that again,1
When things get weird,1
For the hall of fame of fucking off,1
So here's a plaque for your wall,1
You're so bad at loving people back,1
Why's it take so long to text back?,1
Where's your fucking head at?,1
And even when they're here it's like,1
If your indigo,1
I know I'm not around enough to make me worth the wait,1
But I'm holding out,1
"Yeah, if only I could text you",1
I'm the best thing that you'll never have,1
It's too easy to hate you,1
"Now I'm cancelled, I'm whatever",1
Like I do 'cause I'm defeated,1
"Take a seat, babe, if you need it",1
Now my energy's depleted,1
You're cool but inconvenient,1
I feel these feelings quietly,1
"Yeah, you like me in spite of me",1
You're squeezing out my dopamine,1
I like you inconveniently,1
"We both know you'd never stop, you're hard to love",1
Is fall in blame with you (Is fall in blame with you),1
All that I can do (All that I can do),1
Yeah‚ if it's up to me,1
My band and I could play along,1
Forging anxious three minute long,1
But saying that out loud is probably gonna hurt me,1
Nice to fucking meet you,1
By their own culture,1
Shamed out of money,1
They're defeated as fuck,1
"Well, guess, guess, guess, guess what?",1
When bands break up,1
Everyone is sad when,1
You should want the best for me,1
And if you really love me,1
"If you play guitar, you can't want things",1
"Bitch, pay me what you owe me",1
Got nothing from my label,1
I wanna be a millionaire before I'm 30,1
"Watch what happens next, yeah, yeah",1
When you slipped the curse you loved me,1
I never wanted nothing but honesty,1
I don't want my life since you changed your mind,1
And I don't want their money,1
Now I don't want your sex,1
We both lost me,1
Sour green,1
Just give all the people,1
"Just give all the people the truth, truth, truth",1
"Do you want, do you want, do you want to",1
Loneliness was built for two,1
Which has nothing to do with you,1
Let's get a little see-through,1
"""I'll be what all the people want""",1
Laundry lists of problems,1
"They would boo that, they'd abuse that",1
But for some reason that feels wrong,1
Until it's too late,1
I'll never be enough,1
Tell me all the things you want and I will give up me for you,1
"Tell me what I get, tell me what I earn",1
Can I try new sounds? Go fuck yourself,1
"Can I pay rent? Sure, but not much else",1
Tell me everything you're comfortable with and I'll comply,1
Do I get a car? Hope it's not too nice,1
"In how well I live, if my life's okay",1
"Let me get this straight, you want a say",1
It's a cultural hold-back,1
All the fans that like us need an easy fucking format,1
"Like I say, when I say",1
"And that's fucking awesome, we could never do that",1
Like make country songs and hit number one,1
Hip hop can do whatever it wants,1
"I put autotune on ""Worst"" and caught all their disgust",1
I don't think people realize how they're fucking us up,1
To act unstable,1
To turn the tables,1
On myself and everyone,1
Myself and,1
Life's not perfect but I won’t let that define me,1
And I won't play along with the trending anxieties,1
(Bleh!),1
It's like who wants to be close with someone who always goes away?,1
