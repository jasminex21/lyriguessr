Hope it's not too nice\nTell me everything you're comfortable with and I'll comply\nCan I pay rent? Sure, but not much else\nCan I try new sounds? Go fuck yourself\nTell me what I get, tell me what I earn\nTell me all the things you want and I will give up me for you\n\n[Chorus]\nYou don't love me the same\nIt's such a fucking shame\nI don't deserve as much\nAs all your pop faves\nYou wanna hear my art\nBut only on your terms\nSo learn these fucking words\nYou don't love me the same\nIt's such a fucking shame\nI'll never be enough\nUntil it's too late\nYou wanna hear my art\nBut only on your terms\nSo learn these fucking words\n[Post-Chorus]\nI like cool shirts, I like cold rings\nI want a big house, I want nice things\nI want jet packs for all my friends\nI want a big house, I want nice things11Embed"
