Are we falling off?)\nTell me, are we all wrong? (I can't just wait here, for the impending fall)\nI don't wanna think like that\nI don't wanna be like that\nTell me, are we far gone? (Are we all wrong? Are we falling off?)\nTell me, will we fall off? (Regressing slowly, falling from heights to crawl)\nI don't wanna think like that\nI don't wanna be like that\n(I don't wanna be like that)5Embed"
