Ask Geoff\nAnd I'm doing alright\nBut is \"alright\" enough?\nBecause I'm living my dreams\nBut I live at home\n'Cause everything is on the down low for now\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'm two faced from your double exposure\nStop right there, don't come any closer\nI'm two faced from your double exposure\nStop right there, don't come any closer\nI wish I was royal but I'm not\nI wish I was royal but I'm not\nI wish I was royal but I'm not\n\n[Bridge]\nYou won't like what you see\nSo keep your eyes off of me\nI fall in love with everything\nThat wants nothing to do with me\nI know that there's no dealing with the way I'm feeling\nI'm so out of touch with everyone\nAnd everything's a blur to me\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm two faced from your double exposure\nStop right there, don't come any closer\nI'm two faced from your double exposure\nStop right there, don't come any closer\nI wish I was royal but I'm not\nI wish I was royal but I'm not\nI wish I was royal but I'm not\nI wish I was royal but I'm not\nI wish I was royal but I'm not9Embed"

(Okay, I think you might be right)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSee, I'm like you without good moods and\nMy cave's my room where I'll cave too\nYeah, I'm like you without good moods\nAnd you'll be sorry when you come to\n\n[Drop]\nLose your mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nI treat walking the plank\nLike I'm jumping off a diving board\nListening to The Latest Plague\nI breathe nostalgia until I'm bored\nI can't just give a love song\nWithout a bitter aftertaste\nI'm afraid to dive headfirst\nAnd crack my brain out of it's cage\nIt's harder than it should be\nFor me to be straightforward\nLike even when I did\nI couldn't tell her I adored her\nWhich I know is messed up\nAnd I know I messed up\nBut at least I 'fessed up\nNow of course it's too late\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nSee, I'm like you without good moods and\nMy cave's my room where I'll cave too\nYeah, I'm like you without good moods\nAnd you'll be sorry when you come to\n\n[Drop]\nLose your mind\n\n[Chorus]\nI could live on a life raft next to you\nI would swim if it keeps me close to you\nIf you fall I'll swim right back to you\nI could live on a life raft next to you\nI've been building this island every day\nWaiting for the right time to get away\nEvery day, I'm more numb to the Sad Game\nSo I'll just live on this island until I break\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSee, I'm like you without good moods and\nMy cave's my room where I'll cave too\nYeah, I'm like you without good moods\nAnd you'll be sorry when you come to\n\n[Drop]\nLose your mind\n[Chorus]\nI could live on a life raft next to you\nI would swim if it keeps me close to you\nIf you fall I'll swim right back to you\nI could live on a life raft next to you\nI've been building this island every day\nWaiting for the right time to get away\nEvery day, I'm more numb to the Sad Game\nSo I'll just live on this island until I break7Embed"
