Do you wanna marry me?\nDo you wanna run marathons in Long Beach by the sea?\nI've got things to do, like nothing at all\nI wanna do them with you\nDo you wanna do them with me?\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIf you want someone, then just call me up\nAnd remember where I'll be\nSweet in barefeet\nYou can find me where no one will be\nIn the woods somewhere, in the night\nIn the heart of a valley\nIn the sweet north country\nIf I'm not there, come to my house on Genesee8Embed"
