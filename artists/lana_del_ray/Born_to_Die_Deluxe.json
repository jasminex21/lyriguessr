(Got that?)\nWho? Me? (Louder)\nWhy? (Got that?)\n\n[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\nFeet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line\nOh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take\nBut I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine\nWalking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?\nI feel so alone on a Friday night\nCan you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?\nIt's like I told you, honey (Louder)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't make me sad, don't make me cry\nSometimes, love is not enough\nAnd the road gets tough, I don't know why\nKeep makin' me laugh, let's go get high\nThe road is long, we carry on\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\n[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane (Louder, alright)\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\nLost, but now I am found\nI can see that, once, I was blind\nI was so confused as a little child\nTried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find\nAll the answers, honey (Louder)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't make me sad, don't make me cry\nSometimes, love is not enough\nAnd the road gets tough, I don't know why\nKeep makin' me laugh, let's go get high\nThe road is long, we carry on\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\n[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane (Louder, alright)\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\nWe were born to die\n(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)\nWe were born to die\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo don't make me sad, don't make me cry\nSometimes, love is not enough\nAnd the road gets tough, I don't know why\nKeep makin' me laugh, let's go get high\nThe road is long, we carry on\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\n[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\nCome and take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane (Louder, alright)\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\n\n[Outro: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]\n(Louder)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\nWe were born to die\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(Louder)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(Louder)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(Louder)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(We were born to die, we were born to die)\n(Got that?)\n(Louder)365Embed"

Would you be my baby tonight?\nCould be kissin' my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine\n'Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got, don't you know?\nIt's you that I adore, though I make the boys fall like dominoes\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nKiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight\n(D-A-R-K, do it my way)\nKiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight\n(P-A-R-K, let them all say)\n\n[Chorus]\nHey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey\nI know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play\nHey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey\nWhistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay\nNo more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown\nJust you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down\n\n[Verse 2]\nI could be yours, I could be your baby tonight\nTopple you down from your sky forty stories high\nShinin' like a God, can't believe I caught you and so\nLook at what I bought, not a second thought, oh, Romeo\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nKiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight\n(D-A-R-K, do it my way)\nKiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight\n(P-A-R-K, let them all say)\n\n[Chorus]\nHey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey\nI know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play\nHey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey\nWhistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay\nNo more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown\nJust you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down\n\n[Bridge]\nI, I-I want my cake and I wanna eat it too\nI-I want to have fun and be in love with you\nI, I, I know that I'm a mess with my long hair\nAnd my suntan, short dress, bare feet, I don't care\nWhat they say about me, what they say about me\nBecause I know that it's L-O-V-E\nYou make me happy, you, you make me happy\nAnd I never listen to anyone\n(Let them all say)\n\n[Chorus]\nHey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey\nI know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play\nHey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey\nWhistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay\nNo more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown\nJust you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down62Embed"
