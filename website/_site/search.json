I study Statistics and Data Science at UT Austin, and love working on fun projects such as lyriguessr in my free time.\n\nContact me at jasminexu@utexas.edu!\n\nThe idea of lyriguessr all started with tayLyrics, the Taylor Swift-themed game I initially created for myself and my roommate during my freshman year. We’re both Swifties and are avid tayLyrics players - try to beat us on the leaderboard!\nI realized later on that tayLyrics could be generalized to fans of any artist - why not share the fun with everyone, right? So, here’s my little contribution to the music lovers of the world. Enjoy.",
