### ⚔️ The Game

The gist of lyriguessr: earn as many points as possible by guessing the song that the generated lyric(s) comes from. The higher the difficulty level, the more points you get.

> * Easy correct guess: +1
  * Medium correct guess: +3
  * Hard correct guess: +5

If you don't have a guess, you can ask for a hint - there are three hints available for each generated lyric. These hints yield the lyric's album, next line, and previous line, respectively. Or, you could also choose to give up and move on to the next round. But keep in mind that getting hints and giving up will cost you points!

> * Hint (each): -1
  * Giving up: -2
