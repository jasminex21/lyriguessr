### ⚔️ The Game

Earn as many points as possible by guessing the song that the generated lyric(s) comes from. The higher the difficulty level, the more points you get.

> * Easy correct guess: +1
  * Medium correct guess: +3
  * Hard correct guess: +5

If you don't have a guess, you can ask for a hint - there are three available per round, and you start with 20 available per game. You earn one extra hint for each 10 rounds you reach! Or, you could also choose to give up and move on to the next round. But keep in mind that getting hints and giving up will cost you points!

> * Hint (each): -1
  * Giving up: -2
