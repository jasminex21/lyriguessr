    "text": "About me\nHi! I’m Jasmine, the developer of lyriguessr. I study Statistics and Data Science at UT Austin, and love working on fun projects such as lyriguessr in my free time.\n\nBusiness inquiries: contact me at lyriguessr@gmail.com!\n\nThe idea of lyriguessr all started with tayLyrics, the Taylor Swift-themed game I initially created for myself and my roommate Hannah during my freshman year. We’re both Swifties and are avid tayLyrics players - try to beat us on the leaderboard!\nI realized that tayLyrics could be generalized to fans of any artist - why not share the fun with everyone, right? So, here’s my little contribution to the music lovers of the world. Enjoy!\n\nMy favorite artists are Waterparks, Bad Omens, and Taylor Swift. Follow me on Spotify here!\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nA couple people I’d like to thank for their contributions to lyriguessr’s development…\n\nMy awesome roommate (and the love of my life) Hannah, whose love for tayLyrics inspired the creation of lyriguessr\nTrus, for designing the amazing lyriguessr logo and whose encouragement kept me going!",
