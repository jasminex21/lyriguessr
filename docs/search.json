I study Statistics and Data Science at UT Austin, and love working on fun projects such as lyriguessr in my free time.\n\nBusiness inquiries: contact me at lyriguessr@gmail.com!\n\nThe idea of lyriguessr all started with tayLyrics, the Taylor Swift-themed game I initially created for myself and my roommate Hannah during my freshman year. We’re both Swifties and are avid tayLyrics players - try to beat us on the leaderboard!\nI realized that tayLyrics could be generalized to fans of any artist - why not share the fun with everyone, right? So, here’s my little contribution to the music lovers of the world. Enjoy!\n\nMy favorite artists are Waterparks, Bad Omens, and Taylor Swift.",

The higher the difficulty level, the more points you get.\n\n\nEasy correct guess: +1\nMedium correct guess: +3\nHard correct guess: +5\n\n\nIf you don’t have a guess, you can ask for a hint - there are three hints available for each generated lyric. Or, you could also choose to give up and move on to the next round.
