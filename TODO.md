# TODO

### PRIORITY
* Currently, each time I push to the repo, the leaderboard refreshes, bc I keep forgetting to download the leaderboard from the app and then the deployed app pulls from the repo. Surely there is some way I can do this s.t. this doesn't happen. Or if there isn't a straightforward way, I can maybe set something up to download the leaderboards every once in awhile? Really annoying problem tho and ultimately I don't want to have that manual Download Leaderboard button.
