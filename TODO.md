# TODO

### PRIORITY
* DEPLOY ALL APPS THROUGH AWS
    * The ultimate goal is to have a large number of users - Streamlit Cloud is not ideal for handling this. 
* Currently, each time I push to the repo, the leaderboard refreshes, bc I keep forgetting to download the leaderboard from the app and then the deployed app pulls from the repo. Surely there is some way I can do this s.t. this doesn't happen. Or if there isn't a straightforward way, I can maybe set something up to download the leaderboards every once in awhile? Really annoying problem tho and ultimately I don't want to have that manual Download Leaderboard button.

### Artists
* Olivia Rodrigo

### Website
* Create a logo - draw something quickly, something simple that I can draw like a music note with a face
* Perhaps some theme colors? Colors that people can remember and associate with the game. Play around with CSS

### lyriguessr
* Might want to consolidate all the streamlit functions at the top of each app file. Those will not change (pay attention to paths tho).
