# TODO

### PRIORITY
* Currently, each time I push to the repo, the leaderboard refreshes, bc I keep forgetting to download the leaderboard from the app and then the deployed app pulls from the repo. Surely there is some way I can do this s.t. this doesn't happen. Or if there isn't a straightforward way, I can maybe set something up to download the leaderboards every once in awhile? Really annoying problem tho and ultimately I don't want to have that manual Download Leaderboard button.

### Artists
* Taylor
* Waterparks - for me mainly 
    * WIP.
        * Remove Candy and What We Do For Fun. Also check and make sure there aren't any other non-album songs.
* Bad Omens - for me too 
* Olivia Rodrigo

### Website
* Probably restructure to have each link in the table go directly to the game and not to a new page with stats. Maybe *I* like stats, but the general population probably doesn't appreciate it as much. Will try and keep it available somewhere tho. 
    * For the stats, it'd be nice also to mention how many songs are in the dataset.
* Bring back the sidebar?
* Can play around with the draft option that Quarto has where you can keep pages private if they're not ready yet. 
* Need a proper way of sorting the artist games. By genre? Popularity? Alphabetical? Published date?
* Add a page or something that lists the artists who are next to get their games added
* Add a Similar Artists section in each artist's page

### lyriguessr
* Clean up Lyrigetter - it's kinda a mess since I took most of it from my old jupyter notebook. 
* Might want to consolidate all the streamlit functions at the top of each app file. Those will not change (pay attention to paths tho).
* Long-term: would be nice to have a logo! Might just draw one like I did for Spotify Slug ages ago.
